In 2019, more than 100 workers known as The Alliance demanded higher wages, increased transparency about what the job entails, its mental impact, and better working conditions in a petition to management, with a threat to strike. As a result, some workers were suspended.  Sama also allegedly threatened the employees to remove their signatures from the petition by emphasizing that they were replaceable. Daniel Motaung, a key organizer, worked to establish The Alliance as a union but was fired.

Since then, Sama has improved the transparency of the role in their onboarding program. No strike or unionization has happened.

During the pandemic, many content moderators requested sick leave. However, unless they had a not from a specific hospital, HR didn’t grant sick leave. As a result, many continued going to the office, even if they had symptoms.
