Older employees with longer tenures at the company, who would lose 30-40% of their pension checks as a result of the switch, protested this change with rallies, emails to the company, a new online website, and lobbying policymakers in DC. Employees also accused IBM of age discrimination. In September 1999, IBM backtracked on its pension policy change.",

This piece of legislation would require rideshare companies to extend employee benefits to their drivers, who are currently classified as independent contractors. Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.",

In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so. YouTubers Union is designed to serve as a union for YouTube content creators and has over 20,000 Facebook members as of August 9th, 2019 but it is not clear how many are actively involved in the campaign.

The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was pulling out of the Canadian market. ",

The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics. Update: Quotations received from 400 employees.",

The workers, who help Facebook find and triage internal bugs, are unhappy with their employer, the India-based firm WiPro, and have been organizing in the workplace to pressure both companies for improvements. Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE).

The authors noted that they would have attended the walkout \"if Facebook would allow it. As outsourced contractors, non-disclosure agreements deter us from speaking openly about what we do and witness for most of our waking hours.\" The workers also remarked on the lack of protections they receive from their employer. \"We would walk out with you \u2014 if we could afford it. At the moment, content moderators have no possibility, no network or platform or financial security \u2014 especially when we are atomized in pandemic and remotely micromanaged \u2014 to stage an effective walkout without risking fines, our income and even our right to stay in the countries where we live and work.\"",

Besides the risk of being exposed to the virus, workers report long working hours\u2014often more than 14 hours a day\u2014for increasingly low pay, without health insurance or labor rights.",

The agreement did not include a call for higher wages because workers recognized that they are paid relatively high wages and that the company has faced economic pressures as a result of the pandemic. Instead, the contract improved job stability, ensuring \"just cause\" protections against firing and recall rights (priority for re-hiring for the same positions) for workers laid off due to the pandemic.
