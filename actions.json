Older employees with longer tenures at the company, who would lose 30-40% of their pension checks as a result of the switch, protested this change with rallies, emails to the company, a new online website, and lobbying policymakers in DC. Employees also accused IBM of age discrimination. In September 1999, IBM backtracked on its pension policy change.",

A Facebook FTE shared a copy of the letter on Workplace and 'got a lot of positive reception from full time employees and other contingent workers",

This piece of legislation would require rideshare companies to extend employee benefits to their drivers, who are currently classified as independent contractors. Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.",

In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so.

The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was pulling out of the Canadian market. ",

The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics. Update: Quotations received from 400 employees.",

The workers, who help Facebook find and triage internal bugs, are unhappy with their employer, the India-based firm WiPro, and have been organizing in the workplace to pressure both companies for improvements. Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE).

        "description": "Nine current and former Facebook content moderators posted a message of solidarity with the Black community in the wake of the George Floyd protests and in support of the virtual walkout. The authors noted that they would have attended the walkout \"if Facebook would allow it. As outsourced contractors, non-disclosure agreements deter us from speaking openly about what we do and witness for most of our waking hours.\" The workers also remarked on the lack of protections they receive from their employer. \"We would walk out with you \u2014 if we could afford it. At the moment, content moderators have no possibility, no network or platform or financial security \u2014 especially when we are atomized in pandemic and remotely micromanaged \u2014 to stage an effective walkout without risking fines, our income and even our right to stay in the countries where we live and work.\"",

The company used machine learning algorithms to determine the \"reliability\" of a worker and give them preference for certain shifts. The court ruled that the company failed to take valid reasons for cancellation into account, such as medical illness.

The agreement did not include a call for higher wages because workers recognized that they are paid relatively high wages and that the company has faced economic pressures as a result of the pandemic. Instead, the contract improved job stability, ensuring \"just cause\" protections against firing and recall rights (priority for re-hiring for the same positions) for workers laid off due to the pandemic.

Google, Modis (the contracting firm), and the AWU reached a settlement and had Wait's suspension overturned.

However, due to COVID-19, the stipend wasn't instated because interns would work remotely from home. Interns argued, however, that those from lower income backgrounds might need additional funding to find office space during the day or to cover the costs of childcare. Overall, the petition gathered 1500 signatures from interns and Google employees. Google gave the interns a $5,000 stipend to spend on what they deem necessary. ",

        "description": "An open letter was published demanding justice for Jessica (Ming) Tao, a former employee at Google. According to the open letter, \"Google has chosen to put Jessica on unpaid leave while her rapist is still fully employed.\" The letter states that this is a common practice where Google protects the harasser instead of the victim. The letter demands that Jessica is compensated in full for her time on disability leave. The letter demands, \"that survivors involved in future proceedings are always compensated for their time during this traumatizing process.\" Lastly, the letter demands Alphabet to stop having workers go to employee assistance program (EAP) therapy when they face harassment or other workplace abuses.

Workers demand that DoorDash show the tip amount for an order and have a minimum of $4.50 base pay for every order. DoorDash had recently blocked access to an app called Para that allowed workers to see the tip amount before accepting an order. Organizing for the strike began with online posts to Reddit. On the day of the strike, many workers posted online via Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit voicing their struggles. ",
