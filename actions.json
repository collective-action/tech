        "description": "20 subcontractors working at Facebook Reality Labs signed a letter to their contracting firm, Filter Digital, seeking better employment terms. The letter addressed inequities between the Filter employees and other employees at the Facebook facility, including workers employed by other contractors. Ex. Facebook closes its office for 11 holidays per year, according to the letter, but Filter only observes five of those holidays. Since Facebook's offices are closed on those days, preventing the Filter employees from working, they are forced to use six out of their 10 days of paid time off to cover the other holidays \u2013 or go without pay. A Facebook FTE shared a copy of the letter on Workplace and 'got a lot of positive reception from full time employees and other contingent workers",

This piece of legislation would require rideshare companies to extend employee benefits to their drivers, who are currently classified as independent contractors. Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.",

In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so.

Two separate GoFundMe pages have been started to raise money for a memorial and a protest event (over $6,000) and for Chen's family (over $122,000).

Trade union GMB co-ordinated the British demonstrations to take place across two of the busiest shopping days of the year. 'Workers are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,' GMB national officer Mick Rix said in a statement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited protesters outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield. The union cited figures suggesting there had been more than 600 ambulance call-outs to Amazon warehouses over a three-year period and just as many serious incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive for various injuries.",

The workers, who call themselves Amazonians United Sacramento, say that unlike other Amazon employees, they receive no paid time off. These workers, who sort and prepare packages for final-mile delivery in a station called DSM1, said they were told by Amazon managers that they get less paid time off (PTO) because they are classified by the company as Class Q workers.

Notably, all quotes included employee name and company title. Some quotes touched on other ethical issues in addition to climate change, such as the company's contracts with ICE. The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics.",

Under the new rules, shareholders would have to presently hold at least $25,000 worth of shares or have held $2,000 worth of shares continuously for the last three years. The group has argued that this prevents smaller shareholders from voicing their opinion. Included in this group are many recently hired tech employees with small caches of employer stock. While shareholder resolutions are not binding, they have had some success in pushing corporations towards taking a stance on social issues such as gender equity.",

        "description": "Gig Workers Rising launched a petition calling on the heads of the biggest gig economy platforms to give workers paid sick leave amid the coronavirus outbreak. That petition garnered more than 900 signatures. In the petition, the workers say they are often on the \u201cfront lines of exposure,\u201d given that every day they come in contact with various people, including those arriving at airports or heading to the hospital. Without paid sick leave, the gig workers say they are often forced to choose between making ends meet and taking care of their health, and therefore the health of the company's customers. ",

Workers also protested the company's announcement that it would phase out their new paid-leave policy on May 1st.
