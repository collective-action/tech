Older employees with longer tenures at the company, who would lose 30-40% of their pension checks as a result of the switch, protested this change with rallies, emails to the company, a new online website, and lobbying policymakers in DC. Employees also accused IBM of age discrimination. In September 1999, IBM backtracked on its pension policy change.",

The letter addressed inequities between the Filter employees and other employees at the Facebook facility, including workers employed by other contractors. Ex. Facebook closes its office for 11 holidays per year, according to the letter, but Filter only observes five of those holidays. Since Facebook's offices are closed on those days, preventing the Filter employees from working, they are forced to use six out of their 10 days of paid time off to cover the other holidays \u2013 or go without pay. A Facebook FTE shared a copy of the letter on Workplace and 'got a lot of positive reception from full time employees and other contingent workers",

The demonstration is planned for the first day of Prime Day, one of Amazon's flagship shopping events that generates billions of dollars in sales for the retail giant. White collar employees from Amazon HQ (of the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice) in Seattle are flying out to support the protesters.",

The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize.

Two separate GoFundMe pages have been started to raise money for a memorial and a protest event (over $6,000) and for Chen's family (over $122,000). Facebook has since fired one of the employees who organized the protest, Yi Yin. Yin also spoke to the press about the suicide after the company instructed him not to speak about the suicide. ",

The cafeteria workers voted to unionize with a local chapter of Unite Here, which represents 300,000 workers in food, casino, laundry, hotel, and warehouse industries. Workers expressed dissatisfaction with their low wages, which start at $35,000 in the Bay Area, and lack of benefits compared to full-time Google employees.

By Sunday, more than 200 workers had signed a petition requesting an explanation for why they receive fewer paid days off per year than typical Amazon warehouse workers. The workers, who call themselves Amazonians United Sacramento, say that unlike other Amazon employees, they receive no paid time off. These workers, who sort and prepare packages for final-mile delivery in a station called DSM1, said they were told by Amazon managers that they get less paid time off (PTO) because they are classified by the company as Class Q workers. The Sacramento employees said they were previously unaware of any such classification.",

        "description": "Amazon Employees for Climate Action published a Medium post with quotations from 364 employees criticizing the company for its continued involvement with the fossil fuel industry. Notably, all quotes included employee name and company title. Some quotes touched on other ethical issues in addition to climate change, such as the company's contracts with ICE. The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics. Update: Quotations received from 400 employees.",

Under the new rules, shareholders would have to presently hold at least $25,000 worth of shares or have held $2,000 worth of shares continuously for the last three years. The group has argued that this prevents smaller shareholders from voicing their opinion. Included in this group are many recently hired tech employees with small caches of employer stock. While shareholder resolutions are not binding, they have had some success in pushing corporations towards taking a stance on social issues such as gender equity.",

'Uber, Lyft and other gig companies are continuing in the same path of abusing and completely taking advantage of workers while putting them at risk,' rideshare driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising Edan Alva told TechCrunch. This protest comes shortly after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.",

Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE).

However, due to COVID-19, the stipend wasn't instated because interns would work remotely from home. Interns argued, however, that those from lower income backgrounds might need additional funding to find office space during the day or to cover the costs of childcare. Overall, the petition gathered 1500 signatures from interns and Google employees. Google gave the interns a $5,000 stipend to spend on what they deem necessary. ",

        "description": "Over the summer of 2021, a female employee at Alibaba was sexually assaulted by her supervisor after a business meeting where she was expected to drink. The incident became known as the Alibaba incident, or 807--August 7th--which was the date when the victim posted an essay that detailed the night she was sexually assaulted. In her post, she also talked about how, after the incident, she demanded that the perpetrator be fired from Alibaba, but her superiors at the company protected him. \n\nAfter the essay was published, over 6000 employees joined a discussion group to support the victim. On August 8th, they posted a set of recommendations to the company. The post was titled \"Aliren for Aliren\" (\"ren\" means \"people\", so this can be read \"Ali-people for Ali-people\"). The post critiqued the lack of protection of women employee's rights and the incompetency of upper management for not being able to help the victim.  \n\nThe recommendations included giving the victim a paid vacation to emotionally and physically recover from the incident, compensating the victim for her injuries, providing the victim and her family with the necessary counseling/therapy, making the investigation process transparent, providing better training and support to combat sexual harassment and discrimination at the workplace, and reforming HR to better serve the needs of employees (and not just management).

In response, anti-union consultants, such as Kulture Consulting, were reported to have held mandatory anti-union meetings.

The campaign #cancel_efood went viral, and thousands of customers deleted the app and rated the app poorly on the Google Play store. Riders of Wolt, another big food delivery platform, and other workers\u2019 unions expressed solidarity through a protest meeting. eFood has since then announced it would make all contract workers into direct hires.

Environmental advocates, labor groups, and small business owners also participated. They held a press conference on October 6 to protest.

Smalls, a former employee, was fired after organizing a protest for lack of COVID protective gear and poor hazard pay. As an independent union, they hope to avoid Amazon\u2019s anti-union messaging targeted towards established unions. The Amazon Labor Union has begun a union drive. Its goals are to bring back variable compensation pay and stock options that Amazon removed in 2018. In response, Amazon questioned if there was a sufficient number of legitimate signatures from Amazon employees.  Amazon has also taken anti-union tactics, such as displaying anti-union messages in their facilities and bringing in anti-union consultants.",
