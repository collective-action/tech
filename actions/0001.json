The organization was one of the first to speak out against the company's involvement in South Africa and to demand equal pay and better opportunities for promotion for Black employees. They collected data on internal pay guidelines salaries at IBM to increase their leverage with management and supported fellow employees who faced retaliation after speaking out.",
