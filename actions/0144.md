- description: Workers for workers, a group of Facebook employees who organize to support the company's contract workers, started a gofundme campaign to materially support 9 contingent workers who were fired for violating non-existant company policy. Workers for Workers is drawing on its network of mostly tech workers to provide support for the 9 contingent workers who were suddenly let go. The campaign will support these folks in their hour of greatest need, aiming to raise $40,000 to cover their basic living expenses for the next two months as they seek to clear their name within Facebook and find a new job on short notice.
