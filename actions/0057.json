    "description": "Intel announced layoffs in June 2015 and an additional 12,000 layoffs in April 2016. In response, a group of laid-off Intel employees in Portland, OR formed a group called the \"The Intel Eliminati\" in fall of 2015 and launched a website (pdx-tie.org) in June 2016 for former Intel employees. In June 2016, the group had 200+ members. The group's website features career resources, support, and posts critical of Intel and its management, including alleged age discrimination against older Intel employees in the lay-offs.",
