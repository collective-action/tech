    "description": "Organizers say up to 1000 protesters have attended a demonstration held by Silicon Valley workers against the anti-immigration policymaking of US President Donald Trump and his administration. The protest was nearly five-hour-long outside Palo Alto City Hall in objection to Trump's immigration ban as well as in support of immigrants who spark innovation or work blue-collar jobs that keep those tech companies operating.",
