    "description": "Foodora couriers overwhelmingly voted to join the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). 88% of workers who voted supported joining the union. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was leaving the country after the Ontario Labor Board voted to recognize the couriers as company employees. While this makes the vote largely symbolic, it nevertheless makes Foodora's union the first certified gig workers' union in Canada.",
