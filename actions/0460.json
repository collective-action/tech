    "description": "Data center temps who work for Modis, a Google subcontractor, were promised $200 weekly incentive bonuses because of the pandemic. After Modis stopped this program and announced that workers would not receive back pay, the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA workers began organization efforts. Workers filed \u201ctickets\u201d to Modis' management, sent more than 100 messages, and arranged a videoconference. There were also discussions of a work stoppage. Before the scheduled videoconference, however, Modis backtracked their decision in an email. Modis agreed to continue paying the hazard pay until December 19. ",
