    "description": "Hourly retail workers who work for Apple stores are unionizing, with at least two preparing to file paperwork with the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board) and at least six others also involved in unionizing. Workers are unionizing because their hourly raises weren\u2019t enough, considering inflation. Moreover, the Apple workers were inspired by the recent unions at Starbucks. In response, some Apple Store managers have given anti-union speeches, saying that this will lower their wages and force Apple to remove benefits and \u201ccareer experience\u201d opportunities. \n\nIn the past, organizers, including Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett, have been fired. As a result, some Apple corporate employees have expressed support in secret for the retail workers. \n",
