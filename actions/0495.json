    "description": "Fruit Stand Workers United organizers at Apple\u2019s flagship Grand Central Store are collecting signatures to form a union that would be affiliated with Workers United. For the past couple of months, they\u2019ve experienced union-busting tactics from Apple. They\u2019ve also said that they have some allies among the Apple corporate workers. This unionization movement was motivated by the pandemic and consumer price inflation. Their goals are better job security, better pay and benefits, and safer working conditions.",
