    "description": "In response to Dave Chappelle's controversial Netflix special,  Netflix trans employee resource group has released a list of demands and organized a walkout for October 20th. The demands are increased internal conversations about potentially harmful content, the hiring of trans and nonbinary executives, and removing transphobic content in the office; it notably does not include removing Chappelle\u2019s special from Netflix. Also, a leader of the trans-ERG was fired from Netflix because the company concluded that she leaked confidential information. ",
