    "description": "Four anonymous creators started the \u201cWorker Lives Matter\u201d campaign, in which employees of Chinese tech companies log their working hours in a GitHub spreadsheet to protest the \u201c996\u201d working overtime culture. They hope to popularize the \u201c955\u201d instead and have GitHub serve as a reference tool for job seekers. Notably, there was a recent court ruling in China\u2019s top court that made \u201c996\u201d culture illegal in August, but the practice is still used. As of October 28, the official account and website have been permanently banned, and so the project has been suspended. A backup of GitHub data is still available to view.",
