- description: Earlier this year, a group of influential software engineers in Google’s cloud division, referred to as the "Group of Nine", surprised their superiors by refusing to work on a cutting-edge security feature. Known as “air gap,” the technology would have helped Google win sensitive military contracts. The coders weren’t persuaded their employer should be using its technological might to help the government wage war, according to four current and former employees.
