    "description": "After trialling a new payment model, which Deliveroo claims has been a success, the company will begin paying riders a fixed fee per deliver of \u00a33.75 rather than the current hourly rate of \u00a37 per hour plus \u00a31 per delivery. This has left some of Deliveroo\u2019s  couriers unhappy enough to hold something akin to a strike. Outside the Deliveroo headquarters more than 100 self-employed workers gathered calling for the company to keep the hourly rate.",
