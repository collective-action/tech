    "description": "BDS Connected Solutions workers contracted with Google Fiber petitioned the NLRB for formal union recognition. In partnership with the Alphabet Workers Union, the unionization effort was driven by concern over work conditions, pay structure changes, understaffing, and COVID safety issues. Before the vote to determine the eligibility of union votes, workers received a letter from BDS that discouraged them from unionizing by bringing up points like \u201ceveryone will be stuck with the union and forced to pay dues\u201d and that \u201cMissouri is not a right-to-work state.\u201d\n\nAWU has released a statement of solidarity towards the Kansas City workers. A Google spokesperson has responded that BDS will handle this, and Google works with both unionized and non-unionized suppliers. ",
