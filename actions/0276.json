    "description": "Hundreds of Microsoft employees have signed a letter to the company\u2019s top executives asking for Microsoft to take action in the wake of national protests. The initiative came out of a Facebook group called \"Young Microsoft FTEs\". The email to the Microsoft executives includes a list of requests, including increased leniency for Microsoft workers in performance reviews due to the coronavirus pandemic and protests; the company formally condemning the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs; increasing Microsoft\u2019s employee donation matches; the cancellation of contracts with SPD and other law enforcement agencies; support for defunding the SPD; signing a petition for the resignation of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; and support for a list of demands from BLM Seattle. Employees volunteered to be CC\u2019d on the email in a show of solidarity, though their inclusion was not intended to show explicit support for every request, according to the email.",
