    "description": "In response to Etsy CEO Josh Silverman announcing that transaction fees for sellers was increasing from 5% to 6.5%, along with prior stresses like rising fees, mandatory marketing programs, and mass-production sellers, thousands of Etsy sellers are planning to strike by going into vacation mode for a week. They also asked shoppers to boycott Etsy, with 36,000+ signatures on their coworker.org petition.\n\nTheir demands include canceling the fee increase, cracking down on resellers, and creating expedited support tickets.",
