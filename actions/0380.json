    "description": "Glitch workers signed a collective bargaining agreement with company management that will last for 11 months. According to a press release from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), this is the first agreement signed by white collar tech workers in the United States. The agreement did not include a call for higher wages because workers recognized that they are paid relatively high wages and that the company has faced economic pressures as a result of the pandemic. Instead, the contract improved job stability, ensuring \"just cause\" protections against firing and recall rights (priority for re-hiring for the same positions) for workers laid off due to the pandemic.
