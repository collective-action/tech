- description: A group of Amazon employees protested outside the Eagan, Minnesota, warehouse Thursday morning. While past protests have focused on allegedly poor workplace conditions, the Eagan protest was to raise concerns about a lack of parking at the warehouse. This is an issue because these workers' cars can be towed and fined at a cost of hundreds of dollars for being double-parked.
