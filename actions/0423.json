    "description": "Foodpanda delivery workers protested in front of the company's headquarters while seven representatives of the strike tried to negotiate demands with the company. The delivery workers demanded to raise the base rate for deliveries, stop unreasonable termination of workers, end the cash-on-delivery system, and increase insurance coverage for personal accidents. Company management did not accept any of the demands or decide to hold another meeting. ",
