    "description": "Amazon workers in four German facilities (Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Graben, Werne) went on strike before Christmas to pressure the company to accept industry-wide collective bargaining agreements for worker pay. Protests began in May 2013 and have continued throughout the year. A contingent of German workers traveled to Seattle to protest outside of the company's headquarters, joined by U.S. union organizers.",
