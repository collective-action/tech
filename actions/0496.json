    "description": "Thousands of volunteer hackers in Ukraine, many of them employed in the country's tech industry, have strategically targeted Russian government websites in an effort to disrupt war mobilization efforts. They have been joined by sympathetic hackers from other countries. Using DDoS attacks, informally organized groups such as StandForUkraine have succeeded in taking many of these websites offline. Hacktivists in Belarus, organized by CyberPartisans, have also disrupted Russian rail service used to transport Russian troops into Ukraine. Mykhailo Federov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, also announced a volunteer cyber army known as The IT Army of Ukraine. ",
