Amazon closed the call center before the campaign could proceed further due to financial pressures following the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Amazon has disputed unionization by arguing that the employees are owners of the company since they are given stock options.", "locations": ["seattle", "washington", "usa"], "companies": ["amazon"], "workers": 400.0, "tags": ["washtech", "cwa"], "author": "nataliyaned"}
