    "description": "Workers at Mapbox had formed a union with CWA; however, they failed to achieve recognition from the NLRB when workers voted against unionization 123 to 81. The Mapbox Union will continue to represent workers to management. Since then, union members have claimed they experienced retaliation from the company, with some being fired, intimidated, or threatened. As a result, the union plans to file an unfair labor practice charge. ",
