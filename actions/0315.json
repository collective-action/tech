    "description": "Amazon, Google, Uber, Lyft, and Postmates workers were reportedly among the \"tens of thousands\" of employees across the U.S. that took part in a protest of the country's long-standing systemic racism. Those that were unable to leave their jobs were encouraged to take an 8 minute, 46 second break (the amount of time a police officer knelt on George Floyd's neck) or to bend a knee in solidarity (a reference to protests by the NFL). The Washington Post reports that demonstrations took place in over 200 cities.",
