    "description": "French Amazon employees at six warehouses protested and threatened walkouts over lax covid-19 protections, calling for the company to adhere to social distancing, provide personal protective equipment, and initiate employee temperature checks. A spokesperson for Amazon's French CFDT union estimated that between 30-40% of Amazon employees in the country were no longer showing up to work over safety concerns or because of childcare obligations. A French law requires workplaces to keep paying workers who refuse to work over safety concerns. ",
