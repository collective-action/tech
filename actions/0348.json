    "description": "A group of California Uber drivers sued the company for asking drivers to support Prop. 22 (a state proposition that would overrule attempts to classify gig workers as employees) through in-app messaging. The suit seeks an injunction that would stop the messages. The plaintiffs were active in the movement against Prop. 22. They claimed that the company's message that 72% of its drivers support Prop. 22 was false because that percentage was the result of company pressures (including workers' concerns that the company was surveilling their survey answers on the app).
