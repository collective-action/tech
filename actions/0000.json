    "description": "Computer People for Peace (established as Computer People for Peace - name changed in 1970) formed in 1968/1969 in protest of the Vietnam War. The group pressured the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to adopt an anti-war position and NYC members collected 320 signatures on petitions against the military's use of technology. They raised funds to pay for the bail of a fellow programmer, Clark Squire, who was arrested for his activity with the Black Panthers. The group also attended an event at NYU to support work and research stoppages in universities.",
