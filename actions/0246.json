    "description": "Rideshare workers organized under Rideshare Drivers United filed wage claims with the California Labor Commissioner's Office seeking to be reimbursed for unpaid wages under AB5. AB5 took effect on Jan. 1 in California but is being disputed by rideshare companies who seek to keep drivers classified as contractors as opposed to employees.
