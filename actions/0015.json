    "description": "In one of the first reported unionization attempts at a 'dot com company', an affiliate of the Communication Workers of America known as the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTech) sought to unionize a group of 400 customer service employees at Amazon. Amazon closed the call center before the campaign could proceed further due to financial pressures following the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Amazon has disputed unionization by arguing that the employees are owners of the company since they are given stock options.",
