    "description": "Tech workers in the U.K. have started a union aimed at organizing a wide array of tech workers in the country. The United Tech and Allied Workers, a branch of the Communications Workers Union, offers legal counsel and representation at employment tribunals for its members. Under U.K. law, employees can join a union even if that union has not been recognized by their employer.
