- description: Amazon employees, many who are Somali-American workers, at a fulfillment center outside Minneapolis are calling on the company to improve safety and benefits on one of the top sales days of the year. 100 fulfillment workers and labor groups outside the cavernous warehouse are protesting the company's working conditions, benefits and corporate culture. The demonstration is planned for the first day of Prime Day, one of Amazon's flagship shopping events that generates billions of dollars in sales for the retail giant. White collar employees from Amazon HQ (of the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice) in Seattle are flying out to support the protesters.
