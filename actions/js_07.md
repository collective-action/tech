A coalition of drivers released a list of demands, signed by thousands, asking the ride-hailing services to take immediate steps to help ensure their safety. The demands include providing free COVID-19 screenings to all drivers, along with 14 days paid leave for all affected drivers. The drivers are organized with advocacy group Mobile Workers Alliance.
