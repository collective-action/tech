    "description": "A law firm representing 10 current and former contract workers at Microsoft Corp. filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Tuesday against the software giant, seeking damages and full-time employee benefits for its plaintiffs and thousands of other 'misclassified' temporary employees. The 10 plaintiffs seek class-action status because they want to include some 6,000 current full-time Microsoft employees who have been 'misclassified as nonemployees' under 'various erroneous labels' and denied company benefits.",
