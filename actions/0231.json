    "description": "Employees at the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter voted to unionize. The decision, which was formalized by a vote count at the National Labor Relations Board, came down to a narrow margin, with 46 employees voting in favor of the move and 37 opposing it. The debate over a union \u2014 and whether such representation was appropriate for highly paid tech workers \u2014 had been a source of tension at the company for many months.",
