    "description": "A group of Glovo delivery drivers went on strike for one day, citing the loss of guaranteed hours without proper notice and lower pay rates than comparable cities. They also cited Glovo's failure to fulfill promises on worker conditions, including that the company failed to provide promised protective clothing for cold and rain. They gathered at Plaza Chile in Mendoza, Argentina.",
