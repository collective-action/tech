    "description": "Google employees protest at Alphabet's shareholder meeting, joining community activists in demanding change from Google on how it handles sexual harassment in the workplace and its plans to build a censored search engine for China. Around 100 Google employees and community activists also protested as a united group outside Alphabet headquarters during the meeting. Google employees; labor and activist coalition Silicon Valley Rising; SEIU-USWW (a union representing janitorial staff and security officers); and local community groups helped organize the rally outside the meeting.",
