    "description": "The Alphabet Workers Union published an open letter on Twitter calling on YouTube to remove Donald Trump from its website, stating that he repeatedly violated the platform's rules. Earlier in the week YouTube took down one video from Trump where he made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. UPDATE: On January 12th, YouTube announced that it would suspend Donald Trump's account indefinitely. The account remains online but is not allowed to post new videos.",
