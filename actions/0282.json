    "description": "Over 90 individuals and organizations affiliated with MIT have signed a letter to the MIT College of Computing Leadership calling for the college to make a public statement condemning the death of George Floyd, developing a plan to address \"the legacy of anti-blackness and the relationship between technology and policing\", and breaking ties with companies that sell to police departments and ICE. Long-term asks include hiring more Black faculty and recruiting and accepting more Black undergraduate and graduate students.",
