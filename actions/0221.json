The letter called on Google to commit to zero carbon emissions by 2030, end all contracts with fossil fuel companies and climate change denying or delaying 'think tanks, lobbyists, and politicians', and end all collaboration with organizations or individuals 'enabling the incarceration, surveillance, displacement, or oppression of refugees or frontline communities'.
