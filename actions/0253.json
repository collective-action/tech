    "description": "Amazon's French SUD-Commerce union launched a lawsuit against the company alleging that they had failed to uphold coronavirus safety measures at six different warehouses in the country.  French courts ruled in favor of the union. The company was forced to stop its operations for five days, while continuing to pay workers, in order to improve safety. Delivery was also restricted to food, hygiene, and medical products at this time.",
