    "description": "The Chicago chapter of Amazonians United, DCH1, created a petition demanding a $2 pay increase and full 20-minute breaks for workers on the company's megacycle shift, a new shift that runs from 1:20 am -11:50 am. In addition, the petition called for accommodations for workers who are unable to work the shift. In April DCH1 also organized a walkout in protest. On May 19th, Amazon warehouse workers across the country who work on the Megacycle shift began receiving a $1.50-$2.00 pay increase per hour for certain days of the week. ",
