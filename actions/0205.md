- description: Approximately 2,300 contract workers employed in food service at Google have voted to unionize under a local chapter of Unite Here. Workers expressed dissatisfaction with their low wages, which start at $35,000 in the Bay Area, and lack of benefits compared to full-time Google employees. Some reported incidents of discrimination and bullying. The workers are officially employed by Compass Group, a third party contractor. The vote followed a two year effort.
