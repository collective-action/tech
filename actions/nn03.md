- description: Students at Cornell working with Mijente have circulated a petition as part of the broader #NoTechForICE - campaign. The petition calls on Cornell students to boycott recruitment attempts on the part of companies that do business with ICE, Cornell faculty to refuse to participate in research funded by DHS and other elements of the military-prison-industrial-financial-security complex, and Cornell administration to ban recruiters from the complicit companies from campus.
