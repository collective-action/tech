    "description": "In the United Kingdom, four Uber drivers have filed a lawsuit to gain access to Uber's algorithms. The drivers along with The UK App Drivers and Couriers Union argue that under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation they should have access to the data that Uber collects on their drivers. If given access to this data, drivers on the platform will be able to calculate an hourly wage as well as understand why they have been deactivated using trip ratings. ",
