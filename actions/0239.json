    "description": "In an open letter, several engineers, researchers, analysts, and designers working with global companies such as Google and Facebook have condemned the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India. The letter, issued 'in solidarity with the Indian democracy', was posted through the 'TechAgainstFascism' handle on Medium. It called upon technology leaders to take a stance and publicly denounce the 'fascist acts by the Indian government'. 'We call upon the leaders to use technology as a force for good, to refuse to share user details with the government, refuse to shut off the Internet at the government's whim, provide tools for citizen mobilization, and ensure that content moderation is not skewing pro-government,' it said.",
