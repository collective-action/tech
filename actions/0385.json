    "description": "Several of YouTube's employees raised concerns that a music video on the website, \"Meet the Flockers\" by YG, promotes racism towards Asian Americans. The video details a burglary and calls for targeting Chinese communities according to press reports. The employees requested that the company's Trust and Safety team pull the video from the site, which the company declined to do in a statement. Update: In early April, several newspapers reported that the video had been removed from the website. ",
