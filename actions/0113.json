    "description": "Attorneys seek to represent more than 4,200 women in a lawsuit against Oracle that alleged that female employees were paid on average $13,000 less per year than men doing similar work. An analysis of payroll data found disparities with an 'extraordinarily high degree of statistical significance', the complaint said. Women made 3.8% less in base salaries on average than men in the same job categories, 13.2% less in bonuses, and 33.1% less in stock value, it alleges.",
