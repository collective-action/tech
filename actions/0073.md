- description: "Thousands" of Postmates employees activated a Blitz Up app on June 15. The app prevented them from taking any delivery jobs without a "Blitz bonus" of 1.5x the typical rate. The action was taken to protest pay cuts that went into effect May 2019. Blitz Up was created by the Pay Up Campaign, a group of Instacart workers that organized to protest pay cuts in January 2019.
