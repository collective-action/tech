    "description": "In South Africa, Uber drivers are taking part in a class-action lawsuit against the company. Drivers are seeking compensation for unpaid overtime and holiday pay based on South African law. One of the law firms representing South African drivers also represented UK drivers in front of the UK Supreme Court, which ruled on February 19th that drivers must be classified as employees rather than independent contractors in the country.",
