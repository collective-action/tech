    "description": "Rideshare workers have signed a petition calling on the LAX (Los Angeles) airport to provide them with better bathrooms. Currently all workers are forced to use six port-a-potties and one external handwashing station located on airport grounds. LAX management responded by saying they will install three additional port-a-potties and two more external handwashing stations. Drivers, organized through the Mobile Workers Alliance, continue to call for more.",
