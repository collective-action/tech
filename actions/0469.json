    "description": "During the Christmas shipping season, workers organized by Amazonians United staged a walkout at two Chicago Amazon warehouses. Their demands were higher pay for their physically intensive work and better safety conditions considering their high risk for COVID infection. Workers staged a walkout after managers didn\u2019t respond to their petition with similar demands a month ago. Moreover, some workers say that promised bonuses and pay rates were never received. ",
