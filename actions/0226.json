    "description": "About 2,300 Google cafeteria workers (contracted through Compass) voted to unionize to call for better pay and benefits. These workers include dishwashers and food preparers who serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner to Google employees. The service workers are considered contract workers and don't receive the same benefits such as retirement plans which are standard for direct Google employees. The cafeteria workers voted to unionize with a local chapter of Unite Here, which represents 300,000 workers in food, casino, laundry, hotel, and warehouse industries. ",
