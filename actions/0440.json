    "description": "After the online food platform eFood announced that it will change its contract-based workers into freelancers, it sparked a strike and motor-march by its workers. Workers demanded the company to provide motorcycles or pay a 15% additional allowance, pay for the fuel, add protection measures, and allow collective bargaining. eFood also faced social media backlash, even before the strike. The campaign #cancel_efood went viral, and thousands of customers deleted the app and rated the app poorly on the Google Play store. Riders of Wolt, another big food delivery platform, and other workers\u2019 unions expressed solidarity through a protest meeting. eFood has since then announced it would make all contract workers into direct hires. The day after the announcement, the delivery workers held a 24-hour strike as planned.",
