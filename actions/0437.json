    "description": "After news from The Guardian that Google had been illegally underpaying their Temps, Vendors, and Contractors (TVCs) despite pay parity laws in European and Asian countries, over 900 Google employees and subcontractors have signed a petition calling for Google to amend their exploitation of TVCs. They are demanding for Google to repay the TVCs, create a path towards permanent employment, and end its two-tiered perma-temp system. This letter was organized by the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU). Google has acknowledged these issues but hasn\u2019t commented directly on the petition.",
