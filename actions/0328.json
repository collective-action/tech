    "description": "A number of contractors for Google (employed through staffing firm Adecco) have filed a lawsuit alleging that confidentiality agreements with the company deprive them of basic legal rights, such as free speech. Contractors are prevented from discussing wages or working conditions, which they claim prohibit them from \u201cdisclosing violations of state and federal law, either within Google to their managers or outside Google to private attorneys or government officials\u201d. The Sept. 21st filing with a California appeals court reverses a lower court decision, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. ",
