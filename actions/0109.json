The letter addressed inequities between the Filter employees and other employees at the Facebook facility, including workers employed by other contractors. Ex. Facebook closes its office for 11 holidays per year, according to the letter, but Filter only observes five of those holidays. Since Facebook's offices are closed on those days, preventing the Filter employees from working, they are forced to use six out of their 10 days of paid time off to cover the other holidays \u2013 or go without pay.
