    "description": "In response to Activision Blizzard lifting its vaccine mandate, A Better ABK announced that employees will walk out in protest. Their demands are to reverse the lifting of the vaccine requirement, to allow remote work permanently, and to allow each individual employee to decide whether to work remotely or in person. \n\nAs of 4/1/22, Activision Blizzard is operating under a voluntary return to office policy, and each studio will have its own policies regarding the vaccine mandate.",
