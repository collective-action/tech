- description: Before Github’s CEO Nat Friedman delivered his keynote address at Github Universe, an annual Github-hosted conference, dozens of tech workers and immigrant rights activists protested outside with a replica of the cages ICE uses to detain migrant families and children. “The demonstration [is in response to] GitHub's contract with ICE and is intended to show support for the GitHub workers who are organizing internally to get the contract cancelled,” said a representative of Tech Workers Coalition, the group organizing the protest. Just before the annual conference, 5 Githubbers left the company, citing Github's involvement with ICE.
