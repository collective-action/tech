- description: 150 Instacart workers have started a petition to protest changes in how they are paid. The petition urges the company to change this policy. It also encourages Instacart users to pay "shoppers" the minimum $0.22 tip through the app and to pay the remainder of the tip in cash to ensure the tip amount primarily goes to workers.
