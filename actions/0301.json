    "description": "Gig Workers Rising organized an open letter from workers calling for economic justice from their employees, many of whom are Black and Brown, as a means of responding meaningfully to anti-racist protests. The letter calls out companies for releasing statements that \"have included various platitudes about your commitment to Racial Justice and the Black community\" without promising \"real change\". Among the demands are: (1) \"meaningful representation at work\", (2) \"benefits to take care of ourselves and our families\", (3) \"a living wage\", (4) and dropping the AB5 ballot measure. To date, the letter has received over 330 signatures.",
