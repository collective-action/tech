    "description": "A group of Microsoft employees appeared at an employee meeting with CEO Satya Nadella Thursday to protest the companies's treatment of women. It's not clear how many were part of the protest, but some female and male employees at the event wore all white, inspired by the congresswomen who wore suffragette white to the State of the Union in February.",
