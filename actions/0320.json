    "description": "Rideshare drivers protested in Abuja, Nigeria, calling for greater government oversight on pricing for apps like Uber and Bolt. Drivers threatened to go on strike within a week's time if the government did not respond to their demands. Drivers noted the disparity in prices between Abuja and other major cities in Nigeria and surrounding countries. Rising gas prices have also led to decreased profits for many drivers. Several organizations were involved: Abuja City Pilot Forum (ACPF), City Online Drivers Association (CODA) and the Online Hackney Practitioners Association of Nigeria (OHPAN).",
