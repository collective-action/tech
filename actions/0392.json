    "description": "In February, the Alphabet Worker's Union filed two lawsuits against Google for unfair labor practices on behalf of Shannon Wait, a contractor at Google and member of the union. The first lawsuit contested Wait's illegal suspension for supporting a union. The second lawsuit alleged that managers illegally asked Wait and other employees not to discuss their wages. Google, Modis (the contracting firm), and the AWU reached a settlement and had Wait's suspension overturned. Google signed a document that its employees had the right to discuss wage, bonuses, and working conditions. This is the first NLRB settlement with the AWU.",
