But we want our time here to have meant something\" the group said in its letter. A software engineer at WeWork who is helping to organise the WeWorkers Coalition, said 185 people had signed the letter to management, while at least 600 expressed an interest in joining ahead of the group publicising its launch this week.\u00a0The coalition wants cleaners and maintenance staff to receive full benefits and fair pay.", "locations": ["online"], "companies": ["wework"], "workers": 185.0, "tags": ["coworker_solidarity"], "author": "organizejs"}
