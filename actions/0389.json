    "description": "In an open letter, the Telangana State Taxi and Drivers Joint Action Committee (JAC) in India demanded Uber and Ola pay for hospital expenses for drivers who test positive for covid and compensation to their families. The JAC, which comprises more than 20 unions and associations of app-based workers, also called on the companies to provide PPE, increase the rate of the fixed fare, and allow drivers to pick up their evening earnings within at least 3 km of their homes. India reported more than 350,000 cases in a single day on the same day. ",
