    "description": "The ADCU National Executive Committee organized a national 24-hour strike against Uber on September 28th with the hashtag campaign #UberStrike. On the 28th, Uber drivers didn\u2019t log on, and passengers were encouraged to stop using the service or book services. Employees protested about being unfairly dismissed as well as the company failing to pay for waiting time, despite a UK Supreme Court ruling. It is also a protest against the newly introduced fixed price fares. The strike occurred in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, and Nottingham. ",
