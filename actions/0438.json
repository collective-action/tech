Despite a CEO change, Instacart has not changed its practices, so Gig Workers Collective calls on Instacart\u2019s customers to delete the app and support the Collective\u2019s demands with the hashtag #DELETEINSTACART. The demands include: (1) \u201cInstacart shoppers must be paid by order, and not by batch,\u201d (2) \u201cInstacart must re-introduce item commission,\u201d (3) \u201cInstacart\u2019s rating system can no longer unfairly punish shoppers for issues outside their control,\u201d (4) \u201coccupational death benefits,\u201d (5) and \u201cdefault tip must be raised to at least 10% for every single order.\u201d",
