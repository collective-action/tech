    "description": "CS Ed Supports Timnit is an online movement started in response to Dr. Timnit Gebru's firing at Google. Gebru, \"a world renowned researcher on ethics and artificial intelligence\", lost her position after raising concerns about using data being used against marginalized groups of people. CS Ed Supports Timnit wrote an open letter asking for academics, researchers, program providers, and advocates for computer science students to stand in solidarity in with Timnit. They advocate to not stay neutral and address the inequalities across the tech industries. ",
