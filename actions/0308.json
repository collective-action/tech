    "description": "Thousands of delivery workers have engaged in a strike on Wednesday demanding better working conditions in more than 10 Brazilian capitals, as well as in cities in Argentina and Mexico. This was spurred by lack of health benefits in light of the covid-19 pandemic. The workers organized themselves outside the unions with broad popular support as they spread their movement through the internet using the hashtags #BrequeDosApps (brake the apps) and #YoNoReparto (I won\u2019t deliver). Besides the risk of being exposed to the virus, workers report long working hours\u2014often more than 14 hours a day\u2014for increasingly low pay, without health insurance or labor rights.",
