    "description": "DoorDash drivers are working together with a 40,000 person online community (#DeclineNow) to increase their pay by systematically declining orders through the platform. As part of the #DeclineNow movement, DoorDash drivers do not accept orders that pay less than $7, more than twice the current $3 floor. By collectively declining orders, it forces the algorithm to offer the next driver the same delivery but at a higher price. ",
