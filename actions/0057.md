- description: After trialling a new payment model, which Deliveroo claims has been a success, the company will begin paying riders a fixed fee per deliver of £3.75 rather than the current hourly rate of £7 per hour plus £1 per delivery. This has left some of Deliveroo’s  couriers unhappy enough to hold something akin to a strike. Outside the Deliveroo headquarters more than 100 self-employed workers gathered calling for the company to keep the hourly rate.
