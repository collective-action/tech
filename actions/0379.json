    "description": "Contract tech workers of Goodlord have been striking for two weeks because they are being fired and rehired for permanent contracts that have less favorable terms than their current contracts. The contracts have resulted in 20% pay decrease and will have the workers making 6,000 pounds less than the livable wage in London. The workers refuse to work until Goodlord negotiates with them for better pay and benefits. Goodlord is an online platform for tenants, agents, and landlords to utilize in the real estate market. ",
