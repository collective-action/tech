    "description": "21 current and former employees of Blue Origin published an essay that claimed that Blue Origin had multiple issues with sexism and safety. The CEO, Bob Smith was also accused of keeping track of \u201cagitators\u201d and discouraging dissent. Moreover, the letter brings up environmental issues; Blue Origin operates with no consideration of its environmental footprint or permits needed for waste. Smith has responded with a letter that says that the company would \u201creflect\u201d on ways of improvement and that it has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment. He also emphasized that the vehicle was properly certified for First Human Flight.",
