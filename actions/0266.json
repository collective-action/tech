    "description": "Amazon has been sued by workers at two different locations, New York City and Salem, Oregon, for its failure to protect its employees during the coronavirus pandemic. Three Amazon employees from the New York fulfillment center sued the company for failing to follow local public health guidance, claiming the company purposefully miscommunicated with workers. The employees are not seeking compensation, only an order that Amazon comply with guidance. A former employee from Salem alleged that she was fired after taking a medical leave for a coronavirus infection and speaking out publicly about safety issues.",
