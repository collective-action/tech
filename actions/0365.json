    "description": "A court in Bologna, Italy upheld a lawsuit filed by a group of Deliveroo workers, backed by Italy's CGIL union. The lawsuit alleged that Deliveroo's algorithms discriminated against gig workers. The company used machine learning algorithms to determine the \"reliability\" of a worker and give them preference for certain shifts. The court ruled that the company failed to take valid reasons for cancellation into account, such as medical illness. Legal experts say this could be an important precedent in holding companies responsible for algorithms that cause inadvertent harm. ",
