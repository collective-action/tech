- description: Four recently fired Google engineers who were active in organizing within the company say they will push for a federal investigation into the search and advertising giant for unfair labor practices. In a medium post, the four former employees announced their intent to file charges with the National Labor Relations Board for what they allege was retaliation from the company against their roles in organizing workers. In the letter, they write: "Last week, Google fired us for engaging in protected labor organizing."
