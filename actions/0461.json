    "description": "With the slogan \u201cGopuff yourself,\u201d Gopuff drivers plan to strike for 24 hours on Tuesday to demand better pay and working conditions. Specifically, the drivers are demanding an increase in their guaranteed hourly rate and a guaranteed minimum number of hours. They also want increased transparency around termination. The strikes are in response to reduced minimum hourly pay rate and bonuses, to which Gopuff said they were working to improve conditions, and that drivers earn more on average compared to industry rates. The drivers are supported by Working Washington, a pro-labor group.  ",
