    "description": "The union Unite Here Local 2850 has filed unfair labor practice charges against HelloFresh for retaliation, intimidation, and bullying. For example, some workers who were distributing union leaflets outside during lunch break were told this wasn\u2019t permitted, and others were demoted. Moreover, Kulture Consulting consultants have hosted captive audience meetings. A HelloFresh spokesperson has responded, saying that they respect the workers' decision of choosing whether to be represented by a union, and that they will refute the charges.",
