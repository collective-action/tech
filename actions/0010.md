- description: IBM employees launched a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging they faced age discrimation when they were forced to transition from a traditional pension plan to a cash balance plan. The company paid $320 million to settle with 15,000 employees. A federal judge ruled in favor of employees but the company launched an appeals process that dragged on until 2006 when they officially froze pension plans.
