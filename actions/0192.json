    "description": "Google contract workers in Pittsburgh voted to unionize and petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to set up a representation election. Two-thirds of the workers, formally employed by HCL America, were in favor of the action. United Steelworkers helped to organize the union drive through their Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals (PATP) project. News outlets report that this is the first successful unionization of white-collar tech contractors. Workers intend to use their position to bargain for compensation, benefits, and job security comparable to Google employees. Google currently employs more contract workers (135,000) than direct Google employees (115,000) according to the Guardian. A group of Google employees have signed a letter of support and others have published a petition calling for the company to sign a neutrality agreement and abstain from union-busting tactics.",
