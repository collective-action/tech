    "description": "In Nairobi, subcontracted Facebook content moderators employed by Sama face poor wages and working conditions.\n\nIn 2019, more than 100 workers known as The Alliance demanded higher wages, increased transparency about what the job entails, its mental impact, and better working conditions in a petition to management, with a threat to strike. As a result, some workers were suspended.  Sama also allegedly threatened the employees to remove their signatures from the petition by emphasizing that they were replaceable. Daniel Motaung, a key organizer, worked to establish The Alliance as a union but was fired.\n\nSince then, Sama has improved the transparency of the role in their onboarding program. No strike or unionization has happened.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many content moderators requested sick leave. However, unless they had a not from a specific hospital, HR didn\u2019t grant sick leave. As a result, many continued going to the office, even if they had symptoms. \n",
