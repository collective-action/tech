    "description": "Seeking to attract younger workers, IBM announced plans in May 1999 to switch from traditional pension plans to a cash balance model for all American employees. Older employees with longer tenures at the company, who would lose 30-40% of their pension checks as a result of the switch, protested this change with rallies, emails to the company, a new online website, and lobbying policymakers in DC. Employees also accused IBM of age discrimination. In September 1999, IBM backtracked on its pension policy change.",
