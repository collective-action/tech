    "description": "In Germany, 800 Amazon employees at six different locations stopped work ahead of Christmas to protest precarious wages. Strikes were called by trade union Verdi and took place in Bad Herzfeld, Rheinberg, and Werne. The strike was called to push for recognition of the union's collective agreements and paying employees according to those agreements. Verdi is also pressuring Amazon for better health and safety conditions. ",
