    "description": "Former Intel engineer Kourosh Kenneth (\"Ken\") Hamidi alleged wrongful termination and discrimination after his claims for workers' compensation, following a car accident, were denied and he was fired in 1995. He formed a small (~10 member) online group called Former And Current Employees of Intel (FACE-Intel) to coordinate six mass emails over 21 months to Intel employees about company wrongdoing. Intel sued Hamidi and the FACE-Intel group for \"trespass to chattel\" and \"nuisance\" resulting in the California Supreme Court's ruling in Hamidi's favor in Intel Corporation v. Hamidi (2003). The case is considered a landmark ruling on electronic employee communications and concepts of trespass.",
