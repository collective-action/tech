    "description": "An open letter was sent to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, asking him to take a stronger stance on addressing sexual harassment within the company. The letter points out that workers who have been harassed still must work directly or report to those that have harassed them. Moreover, the letter points out to a trend where the company protects harassers and not the victim. ",
