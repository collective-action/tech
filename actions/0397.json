    "description": "Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union ran a survey of its members, who are rideshare drivers and delivery workers in the state of Telangana in India. 495 drivers and delivery workers tested positive for COVID-19 and 4 have died, according to the survey. The Union is calling on the government to tell app-based companies to provide health insurance as well as prioritize covid vaccinations for workers and their families. The app-based companies, which include prominent names such as Uber and Ola, do not currently provide any health insurance for the drivers. India reported more than 350,000 cases in a single day on the same day. ",
