    "description": "Over a hundred Amazon workers and their supporters gathered outside the facility to protest working conditions that they say only worsen as the e-tailing giant gears up to deliver a rush of packages ahead of Christmas and Hanukkah. 600 workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in New York signed a letter and protested working conditions. Amazon workers face injury rates over three times the industry average, and are asking for increased break time and better transit benefits.",
