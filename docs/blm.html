    <h2 id="section1">Tech Workers Against White Supremacy</h2>
    <p>In recent weeks, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and countless other Black Americans have compelled thousands of people across the US and the world to take collective action against systemic racism. Mass protests have made headlines and forced a renewed reckoning with centuries of violence inflicted on Black communities by white supremacy. As many Black activists and scholars have argued<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>, ending white supremacy will require the radical reconstruction of our entire society.<p>
    <p>Crucially, this involves changing the material conditions that make Black lives matter less. We cannot achieve racial justice and create a secure and thriving democracy without also transforming our economic systems, Michelle Alexander <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html">wrote</a> in a recent New York Times op-ed. This point is frequently emphasized by Black Lives Matter organizers, who have centered the demand for economic justice from the beginning. The Movement for Black Lives <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/economic-justice/">platform</a> calls for universal health care, a living wage, and stronger labor rights, while abolitionists have consistently <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/resisting-policing-dismantle-divest-defund/">drawn</a> a link between divesting from policing and prisons and investing in services that feed, house, educate, and employ Black people.</p>
    <p>Within the tech industry, the link between racism and economic deprivation is particularly stark. Black people are disproportionately represented in roles that are contingent, poorly paid, and highly surveilled, from delivery workers to ride-hail drivers to warehouse workers. An <a href="https://medium.com/@catalina.brennan.gatica/sign-on-open-letter-to-gig-companies-regarding-black-lives-matter-4b48420e238d">open letter from Gig Workers Rising</a> describes how tech firms exploit such workers: denying them living wages, essential benefits, and representation within the workplace. The conditions that make police killings of Black people possible and inevitable are the same conditions that make the exploitation of Black and brown workers possible and inevitable, the letter reads. Racism is profitable, in other words: it lets the tech industrys predominantly white male leadership devalue certain kinds of workers and certain kinds of labor. Even in white-collar positions within tech firms, Black workers earn lower salaries on average.</p>

    <h2>Anti-Racism in Tech</h2>
    <p>For the two years that we have been archiving the history of <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/">collective action in the tech industry</a>, we have seen workers across roles, companies, and geographies building anti-racist coalitions. Now is the moment to elevate that organizing into an industry-wide movement for Black lives. Here are some next steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, we have to acknowledge that the tech industry has a long history of anti-Blackness. In 1979, IBMs computer system was being used to run South Africas apartheid-era passbook system. Workers at the company formed an organization (<a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~cale/cs201/apartheid.comp.html">IBM: Speak Up!</a>) to protest the company's role in perpetuating racism. Under worker pressure, the company officially divested from South Africa in 1987. In 2019, white-collar Black employees at Facebook published an <a href="https://www.theroot.com/black-facebook-workers-write-open-letter-to-company-we-1839776402">anonymous memo</a> documenting how the micro and macro aggressions they experienced on a daily basis left them feeling like we do not belong here. These actions are forty years apart but show a continuous thread of anti-Black sentiment, rhetoric, and action within tech companies.  They also demonstrate how tech workers can organize to hold our employers accountable. Too little has changed during this time. Organizing is a proven pathway to change.</li>

    <h2 id="section2">Steps to Collective Action</h2>
    <p><strong>Build A Collective</strong></p>
    <p>Organizing your workplace takes courage and deep solidarity.  One to one conversations about the current state of an issue and how your coworkers feel about it is the number one tool in your toolbox.  Here are the steps we recommend for building your collective:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inner Circle</strong>
        <br>
        Start with the people you know and feel comfortable chatting with about difficult topics.  Can you think of 3-5 coworkers who want to see more accountability from management?  These are generally your workplace friends or folks whove already openly expressed dissatisfaction with your companys commitment to dismantling systemic racism. Heres an example of how to reach out to your friends:
        <div class="grey-box">
          "Hiya, friend!  Did you see (the open letter from Microsoft employees / the CEO of Snap is refusing to publish diversity reports / Amazon is only committing to a one-year moratorium of police use of Rekognition)?"
          <br><br>
          "Ya, I thought that was __ too.  It made me think about our own company and how management has pretty much just made a vague statement about BLM."
          <br><br>
          "Has anyone else mentioned how we could do more as a company?  Maybe we should start working on a statement to management about how our company needs to do better."
          <br><br>
          "Im in, are you in?"
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="section3">Templates for Collective Action</h2>
    <p><strong>Sample outreach conversation</strong></p>
    <div class="grey-box">
      <p>"Hey I saw this template shared on social media. I think a lot of the demands apply to us. Do folks want to talk through how we can use this?"</p>
      <p>"Our management has already put out X statement, but I think we - as workers - should get together and come up with a Black Lives Matter solidarity statement so that were making this demand from the bottom up."</p>
      <p>"Leadership has committed to making changes but its not enough. Its time we make internal changes that address systemic racism with the urgency this moment calls for. We are the workers who build this platform so we should have the power to demand accountability."</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Template Demand Letter</strong></p>
    <p>COMPANY has made a Black Lives Matter solidarity statement, weve had a group meeting, and weve heard from leadership about the need for change.  Leadership has committed to making changes but its not enough. Its time COMPANY makes internal changes that address systemic racism with the urgency this moment calls for.  We are the workers who build this platform and we demand accountability.</p>
    <p>&lt;Sentence or two about company values and how they are not living up to them if they continue to participate in systemic racism.&gt;</p>
