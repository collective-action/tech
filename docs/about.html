        "Surveillance capitalism depends on the social, and it is only in and through <b>collective social action</b> that the larger promise of an information capitalism aligned with a flourishing third modernity can be reclaimed." - Shoshana Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

    <p>Collective Action in Tech is a project that attempts to document all collective actions from workers in the tech industry. The goal of this archive is to provide data and insights on organizing in the tech industry, to find the connections between different efforts, and to build worker power in tech.</p>
    <p>The archive lives on GitHub as a repository. Please visit our repository for more information.</p>
    <p>Collective Action in Tech is maintained by <a href="https://twitter.com/ClarissaRedwine">Clarissa Redwine</a>, former Kickstarter union organizer, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/organizejs">JS Tan</a>, a tech worker, and <a href="https://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/nataliya-nedzhvetskaya">Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya</a>, a sociologist who researches tech and labor.
