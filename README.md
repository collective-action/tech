# Collective Actions in Tech

![silicon valley unite](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iiwV2sQj6hm4/v0/1000x-1.jpg)

This repository is an attempt to document all collective actions from tech and adjacent industries included gaming, communications, and digital media. The goal of _Collective Action in Tech_ is to give us, tech workers, insights on trends in worker power in the tech industry. This archive is meant to provide us with the data to  find the connections between different struggles and to let us reflect collectively on moments in tech labor.

    Google employees have signed an open letter published Tuesday on Medium demanding that the company cease work on Project Dragonfly, which is aimed at creating a search engine that the Chinese government would be able to control to censor certain results and surveil users. "International human rights organizations and investigative reporters have also sounded the alarm, emphasizing serious human rights concerns and repeatedly calling on Google to cancel the project," the letter reads in part. "So far, our leadership's response has been unsatisfactory."

    Workers of Oracle Korea have been sat outside the main office for more than 50 days after 19 negotiations with the management from December to April failed. This is now the longest strike by employees of a foreign IT company in Korea. "Some people think we don't need a union because they believe we work at a leading global IT company and have well-paid jobs," Kim Chul-soo, president of the Oracle labor union, said. "It's not true at all."
