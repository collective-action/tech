# Collective Action in Tech
![Airtable](https://github.com/collective-action/tech/workflows/Airtable/badge.svg)

This repository documents all collective actions from workers in the tech industry.

For the purposes of this project, the tech industry is defined to include any companies whose core business is information technology. We are excluding adjacent industries such as gaming and digital media.

The goal of this archive is to provide data and insights on organizing in the tech industry, to find the connections between different efforts, and to build worker power in tech.

**This repository is meant to be a live document. We need your help to ensure its accuracy and completeness! Add new actions by filling out this [form](https://airtable.com/shrT1A5QWKtquXv3D).**

    Shipt shoppers are organizing a handful of actions in protest of Shipt’s new pay structure that began rolling out this month.  The first action is happening from Saturday, Oct. 17 through Oct. 19, when workers are calling on their fellow Shipt shoppers to walk out and boycott the company. Organizers are asking for shoppers not to schedule any hours or accept any orders during that time.

    At least 290 Facebook employees and contractors signed a petition demanding a 50% wage increase as hazard pay for site moderators who have been forced to return to the office by October 12th of this year. Additional demands include compensation for all costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment, as well as additional time off and an expedited time off review process. Accenture, which hired the moderators as contractors, informed them on October 1st that they would have to return to their office in Austin, Texas. A Facebook spokesperson said the reason for the return was that "some of the most sensitive content can’t be reviewed from home". Full-time, directly hired Facebook employees don't have to return to the office until July 2021.

    More than 60 Coinbase employees chose to leave the company, opting for a severance package, to protest CEO Brian Armstrong's assertion that employees should not participate in social activism in the workplace. This represents roughly 5% of the company's employees. This event follows several months of internal activism within the company after management failed to make a public statement on the Black Lives Matter movement.

    Tech workers in the U.K. have started a union aimed at organizing a wide array of tech workers in the country. The United Tech and Allied Workers, a branch of the Communications Workers Union, offers legal counsel and representation at employment tribunals for its members. Under U.K. law, employees can join a union even if that union has not been recognized by their employer. In an interview with Vice, a member highlighted the union's "very broad definition of a tech worker", which spans white collar and blue collar labor.

    A number of contractors for Google (employed through staffing firm Adecco) have filed a lawsuit alleging that confidentiality agreements with the company deprive them of basic legal rights, such as free speech. Contractors are prevented from discussing wages or working conditions, which they claim prohibit them from “disclosing violations of state and federal law, either within Google to their managers or outside Google to private attorneys or government officials”. The Sept. 21st filing with a California appeals court reverses a lower court decision, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.

    Rideshare drivers protested in Abuja, Nigeria, calling for greater government oversight on pricing for apps like Uber and Bolt. Drivers threatened to go on strike within a week's time if the government did not respond to their demands. Drivers noted the disparity in prices between Abuja and other major cities in Nigeria and surrounding countries. Rising gas prices have also led to decreased profits for many drivers. Several organizations were involved: Abuja City Pilot Forum (ACPF), City Online Drivers Association (CODA) and the Online Hackney Practitioners Association of Nigeria (OHPAN).

    24 employees of tech non-profit Do Something walked off the job, calling for the resignation of current CEO Aria Finger. They have also sent two direct letters to the CEO and Board of Directors that have been shared on Twitter. Former employees shared experiences of racial discrimination and harassment via social media earlier this year. The letter states that Finger reacted to these posts by calling them untrue or "standard-issued American forms of microaggression and racism". Finger returned in August after a legal investigation did not find evidence of discrimination under her tenure.

The actions are designed to target companies, e.g. certain restaurants, that workers believe to be part of the exploitation. An outright strike was deemed too expensive by the workers, many of whom report working 60-70 hours a week to make ends meet. Actions will also include flyering and a demonstration.

Workers also called for consumers to boycott the service. Shipt has more than 100,000 workers in the U.S. and is used by companies such as Target. Willy Solis, from the Gig Workers Collective, was the lead organizer for the event and used social media groups and word-of-mouth (encouraging each committed worker to recruit five additional participants) to drive the strike.

    Thousands of delivery workers have engaged in a strike on Wednesday demanding better working conditions in more than 10 Brazilian capitals, as well as in cities in Argentina and Mexico. This was spurred by lack of health benefits in light of the covid-19 pandemic. The workers organized themselves outside the unions with broad popular support as they spread their movement through the internet using the hashtags #BrequeDosApps (brake the apps) and #YoNoReparto (I won’t deliver). Besides the risk of being exposed to the virus, workers report long working hours—often more than 14 hours a day—for increasingly low pay, without health insurance or labor rights.

    Two former Pinterest employees, both Black women, spoke out on Twitter about the racism they experienced in the workplace. One of the employees, Ifeoma Ozoma, said she was not being fairly paid according to company data. She also said she had to come up with a list of pros to defend promoting former slave plantations for wedding venues. After speaking out, a white employee of the company doxxed her, placing her personal contact information online. He was fired soon after. Another former employee, Aerica Shimizu Ban, said her expenses with Black organizations had been repeatedly questioned.

The letter calls out companies for releasing statements that "have included various platitudes about your commitment to Racial Justice and the Black community" without promising "real change". Among the demands are: (1) "meaningful representation at work", (2) "benefits to take care of ourselves and our families", (3) "a living wage", (4) and dropping the AB5 ballot measure. To date, the letter has received over 330 signatures.

In April 2020, Foodora announced it was leaving the country after the Ontario Labor Board voted to recognize the couriers as company employees. While this makes the vote largely symbolic, it nevertheless makes Foodora's union the first certified gig workers' union in Canada.

The workers also remarked on the lack of protections they receive from their employer. "We would walk out with you — if we could afford it. At the moment, content moderators have no possibility, no network or platform or financial security — especially when we are atomized in pandemic and remotely micromanaged — to stage an effective walkout without risking fines, our income and even our right to stay in the countries where we live and work."

    Contract workers for Facebook in Austin, Texas, say they have been retaliated against for union organizing, resulting in two workers’ departure in recent weeks. The workers, who help Facebook find and triage internal bugs, are unhappy with their employer, the India-based firm WiPro, and have been organizing in the workplace to pressure both companies for improvements. Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE). The organization is especially interested in organizing workers who, like the Austin-based contingent Facebook workers, perform work for major tech firms but aren’t directly employed by them.

'Uber, Lyft and other gig companies are continuing in the same path of abusing and completely taking advantage of workers while putting them at risk,' rideshare driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising Edan Alva told TechCrunch. This protest comes shortly after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.

In late April, Amazon announced that it would end its unlimited unpaid leave policy on May 1. The policy, which was introduced in response to COVID-19, allowed workers to call out sick without penalty. As of Wednesday, more than 5,300 workers from 350 locations, including Amazon warehouses, delivery pick-up stations, and Whole Foods stores, had signed onto petitions. The action was organized by a number of labor groups including the Athena coalition.

In addition to taking to Twitter, activists have started GoFundMes and mutual aid campaigns to benefit workers.

    Rideshare workers organized under Rideshare Drivers United filed wage claims with the California Labor Commissioner's Office seeking to be reimbursed for unpaid wages under AB5. AB5 took effect on Jan. 1 in California but is being disputed by rideshare companies who seek to keep drivers classified as contractors as opposed to employees. Under AB5, many drivers would be entitled to higher wages, pay for overtime, and compensation for work-related expenses.

    Members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice submitted comments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against a new regulation that would prevent smaller shareholders from proposing shareholder resolutions (i.e. proposals to change how a company is run). Under the new rules, shareholders would have to presently hold at least $25,000 worth of shares or have held $2,000 worth of shares continuously for the last three years. The group has argued that this prevents smaller shareholders from voicing their opinion. Included in this group are many recently hired tech employees with small caches of employer stock. While shareholder resolutions are not binding, they have had some success in pushing corporations towards taking a stance on social issues such as gender equity.

    Amazon Employees for Climate Action published a Medium post with quotations from 364 employees criticizing the company for its continued involvement with the fossil fuel industry. Notably, all quotes included employee name and company title. Some quotes touched on other ethical issues in addition to climate change, such as the company's contracts with ICE. The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics.

    Many of the app's 130,000 workers claim to have seen their pay drop by more than 50 percent in 2019 alone, as the company has sought to lower costs and appease its investors. Workers are now calling for a national boycott. They’re asking customers and the general public to tweet under the hashtag #DeleteInstacart on January 19, and to email Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta on January 20, asking him to restore the 10 percent default tip—which workers lost back in 2016. (The default tip sits at five percent.)

    More than 30 Amazon workers at a Sacramento warehouse walked off the job, demanding they receive paid time off. 36 workers — out of around 100 in total on the shift— left work two hours early after they read a letter to management out loud stating their demands to be granted paid time off (PTO) and meet with management to discuss their concerns, according to a worker at the site. These workers — who say they lift hundreds of packages a day in “back-breaking” labor —currently receive zero PTO days a year. The walkout comes weeks after workers say management has ignored their requests to meet with leaders of a group organizing around the issue. So far, workers have circulated an internal and public petition gaining over 4,000 signatures in total.

'We call upon the leaders to use technology as a force for good, to refuse to share user details with the government, refuse to shut off the Internet at the government's whim, provide tools for citizen mobilization, and ensure that content moderation is not skewing pro-government,' it said.

    Amazon delivery station employees in Sacramento are demanding fair treatment and benefits equal to those of other Amazon workers. By Sunday, more than 200 workers had signed a petition requesting an explanation for why they receive fewer paid days off per year than typical Amazon warehouse workers. The workers, who call themselves Amazonians United Sacramento, say that unlike other Amazon employees, they receive no paid time off. These workers, who sort and prepare packages for final-mile delivery in a station called DSM1, said they were told by Amazon managers that they get less paid time off (PTO) because they are classified by the company as Class Q workers. The Sacramento employees said they were previously unaware of any such classification.

Trade union GMB co-ordinated the British demonstrations to take place across two of the busiest shopping days of the year. 'Workers are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,' GMB national officer Mick Rix said in a statement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited protesters outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield. The union cited figures suggesting there had been more than 600 ambulance call-outs to Amazon warehouses over a three-year period and just as many serious incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive for various injuries.

    A group of roughly 200 Googler and other protesters rallied outside of the search giant’s offices in San Francisco on Friday, demanding the company reinstate two colleagues who they say were unjustly punished for workplace organizing at the company — calling it an attack on accountability and transparency in tech. Google has said the employees were placed on administrative leave for violating company policies about accessing sensitive internal documents and monitoring employees’ calendar events. They accuse management of targeting Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland, because of their involvement in worker activism at the company. Rivers helped put together a petition against Google’s work for US immigration enforcement agency Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and Berland was involved with employee protests about hate speech policies on YouTube. Protesters are demanding that Rivers and Berland be reinstated at work immediately. Organizers called their suspension an “attempt to silence workers,” in an email about the rally.

Workers at the company have started publicly posting and speaking out about the mistreatment of international workers, who are only allowed to stay in the US if they are sponsored by their employer and thus face greater pressures not to speak out against working conditions. Two separate GoFundMe pages have been started to raise money for a memorial and a protest event (over $6,000) and for Chen's family (over $122,000). Facebook has since fired one of the employees who organized the protest, Yi Yin. Yin also spoke to the press about the suicide after the company instructed him not to speak about the suicide.

    A group of Amazon employees protested outside the Eagan, Minnesota, warehouse Thursday morning. While past protests have focused on allegedly poor workplace conditions, the Eagan protest was to raise concerns about a lack of parking at the warehouse. This is an issue because these workers' cars can be towed and fined at a cost of hundreds of dollars for being double-parked.

    Foodora couriers in Toronto are preparing to vote on union certification in what could create Canada's first unionized workforce of app-based workers. An application by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers was filed last week with the Ontario Labour Relations Board, months after a campaign was launched that addressed working conditions. The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was pulling out of the Canadian market.

The campaign is calling for greater transparency into YouTube's monetization policy, individual responses to queries about videos that have been taken down by the site, creation of an independent mediation board, and formal representation from content creators in the company's decision-making process. In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so. YouTubers Union is designed to serve as a union for YouTube content creators and has over 20,000 Facebook members as of August 9th, 2019 but it is not clear how many are actively involved in the campaign. It does not require dues from its members.

Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.

    Tech workers organized by the Tech Workers Coalition are protesting the Palantir's contract with ICE on the company's GitHub projects. The plan calls for organized waves of digital protesters to post a prepared message to their GitHub boards. The protest appeals to workers to consider their role, even if indirectly, in Palantir’s work with ICE. It also encourages people to add their own personal sentiments.

    Staff at US-owned tech giant Oracle's China Development Centre in Beijing have staged protests after the company fired 900 staff from its China team, making up 60 per cent of its research and development effort there. Employees blamed tensions between the US and China for the cuts which came in the same week as the US announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods. An employee referred to the Oracle co-founder's interview with Fox Business last October, in which Larry Ellison said that 'we [the US] have a serious competition going with China, I’m on Team USA', and 'if we let China produce more engineers than we do, if we let China's technology companies beat our technology companies, it won't be long that our military is behind technologically also'.

    A group of Instacart delivery workers is waging an ongoing 'soft strike' against the companies to demand better pay this Thanksgiving weekend for the third year in a row. The workers, who are independent contractors, say a recent change to the grocery delivery platform's pay structure was an effective pay cut that’s threatening their livelihoods. As a result, they’re refusing to deliver extra-heavy items, drive more than eight miles per order, or accept time-consuming, low-paying jobs. A group of delivery workers wrote  a letter sent to Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta.

    Blue Apron employees have filed a class-action lawsuit against the companies, alleging that they weren't paid overtime, or for meal breaks, among other labor law violations. They are seeking back pay for missed wages and a trial by jury. Blue Apron employs thousands of low-wage workers in food processing plants in New Jersey, Texas, and California, where this suit was filed. An employee alleges that Blue Apron routinely forced hourly employees to clock out before their meal break, effectively cheating them out of thirty minutes of pay per shift, a practice known in the world of labor law as “time shaving.”

The 10 plaintiffs seek class-action status because they want to include some 6,000 current full-time Microsoft employees who have been 'misclassified as nonemployees' under 'various erroneous labels' and denied company benefits.

    Polaroid workers affiliated with the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement (PRWM) rallied at an anti-apartheid protest in Technology Square in Cambridge, MA and organized what is believed to be the first anti-apartheid boycott of a U.S. corporation. The organization was founded by two of the company's Black employees, Caroline Hunter (a chemist) and Ken Williams (a photographer). The two employees discovered that Polaroid was selling equipment to the South African government that allowed for a racist system of surveillance known as passbooks. The company responded by the surveilling and threatening the workers, first denying and then continuing their operations, and starting a public relations campaign to improve their image.
