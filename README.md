    Separate from the unionizing employees in New York, retail workers at an Atlanta Apple Store have filed with the NLRB for a union election, with wages being the main reason for unionization. The organizers say that they don’t make a living wage. Over 70% of the 100 eligible workers have signed union authorization cards, and they would be represented by the CWA.

    Despite heavy anti-union tactics, including texts and mandated anti-union meetings, Amazon workers at Staten Island voted to unionize 2,654 to 2,131 under the Amazon Labor Union. This marks the first union ever at the company. 

High attrition and firings, poor workplace safety considering the pandemic, and a "culture of fear" from constant monitoring have increased interest in unionization. ALU being a union composed of current employees instead of being an outside group was also effective in foiling Amazon’s anti-union messages.

Amazon plans to file an objection to the NLRB.

    In response to Activision Blizzard lifting its vaccine mandate, A Better ABK announced that employees will walk out in protest. Their demands are to reverse the lifting of the vaccine requirement, to allow remote work permanently, and to allow each individual employee to decide whether to work remotely or in person. 

As of 4/1/22, Activision Blizzard is operating under a voluntary return to office policy, and each studio will have its own policies regarding the vaccine mandate.

    In response to Etsy CEO Josh Silverman announcing that transaction fees for sellers was increasing from 5% to 6.5%, along with prior stresses like rising fees, mandatory marketing programs, and mass-production sellers, thousands of Etsy sellers are planning to strike by going into vacation mode for a week. They also asked shoppers to boycott Etsy, with 36,000+ signatures on their coworker.org petition.

Their demands include canceling the fee increase, cracking down on resellers, and creating expedited support tickets.

    Microsoft, SAP SE, and IBM have continued to maintain operations in Russia. In response, groups of workers at these companies have called for them to do more than just end new sales and to instead withdraw completely. Workers also discussed and criticized the companies’ stances in internal discussion forums, with some Microsoft workers even threatening to quit if the company doesn’t exit. Other workers worry about the withdrawal’s potential effect on civilians.

    Thousands of volunteer hackers in Ukraine, many of them employed in the country's tech industry, have strategically targeted Russian government websites in an effort to disrupt war mobilization efforts. They have been joined by sympathetic hackers from other countries. Using DDoS attacks, informally organized groups such as StandForUkraine have succeeded in taking many of these websites offline. Hacktivists in Belarus, organized by CyberPartisans, have also disrupted Russian rail service used to transport Russian troops into Ukraine. Mykhailo Federov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, also announced a volunteer cyber army known as The IT Army of Ukraine.

    Fruit Stand Workers United organizers at Apple’s flagship Grand Central Store are collecting signatures to form a union that would be affiliated with Workers United. For the past couple of months, they’ve experienced union-busting tactics from Apple. They’ve also said that they have some allies among the Apple corporate workers. This unionization movement was motivated by the pandemic and consumer price inflation. Their goals are better job security, better pay and benefits, and safer working conditions.

    Google is expanding its North Carolina offices located in the “Triangle Area” for increased diversity in the workforce. However, workers expressed concern over the workers’ lower salaries and stock equity grants. In a letter, employees asked for increased transparency about regional salary calculations and the removal of the salary cut. Moreover, many workers had relocated to the Triangle Area during the pandemic due to remote work for more affordable living expenses.

The Alphabet Workers Union has also created an open letter that expressed their grievances with the salary in the Triangle Area.

In response, a spokesperson has said that their compensation guidelines in the area exceed the market pay benchmarks and that employees haven’t had a reduction in salary or existing equity grants.

    Hourly retail workers who work for Apple stores are unionizing, with at least two preparing to file paperwork with the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board) and at least six others also involved in unionizing. Workers are unionizing because their hourly raises weren’t enough, considering inflation. Moreover, the Apple workers were inspired by the recent unions at Starbucks. In response, some Apple Store managers have given anti-union speeches, saying that this will lower their wages and force Apple to remove benefits and “career experience” opportunities. 

In the past, organizers, including Janneke Parrish and Cher Scarlett, have been fired. As a result, some Apple corporate employees have expressed support in secret for the retail workers.

    In response to the economic crisis in Turkey, food delivery company, Yemeksepeti Banabi, announced a 10% raise in salary, which sparked outrage, and its delivery workers of Yemeksepeti Banabi are striking for higher wages. They are also demanding to change the business model, in which they are considered self-employed and don’t have social security. A majority union, The All Shipping Workers Union, has been formed, but the company is preventing unionization rights from being implemented through legal loopholes. 

In similar Turkish companies like Trendyol Express, Yurtiçi Cargo, Scotty, Aras Cargo, Sürat Cargo, and Migros Warehouse, delivery workers also protested the miniscule wage increase. Trendyol Express workers succeeded in a wage increase from 11% to 39%. 

The head of the Transportation Workers Union expressed solidarity and support.

    After a tornado disaster led to the death of 6 workers in an Amazon warehouse, Amazon employees are demanding changes in policy, including the ability to keep their phones with them during their shifts and changes in pay and excused absence policy in the case of severe weather. Other demands include an hourly pay raise, 20 minute breaks, and an appeals process for terminations. Signed petitions that were organized by Amazonians United were offered to warehouse managers, but some managers have refused to accept it. These actions were also motivated by reports of workers still having to show up in dangerous weather due to fear of losing their jobs.

Smalls, a former employee, was fired after organizing a protest for lack of COVID protective gear and poor hazard pay. As an independent union, they hope to avoid Amazon’s anti-union messaging targeted towards established unions. The Amazon Labor Union has begun a union drive. Its goals are to bring back variable compensation pay and stock options that Amazon removed in 2018. In response, Amazon questioned if there was a sufficient number of legitimate signatures from Amazon employees.  Amazon has also taken anti-union tactics, such as displaying anti-union messages in their facilities and bringing in anti-union consultants.

    With the backing of Foxglove Legal, Facebook contract moderators at Accenture are protesting low wages with a mobile billboard and internal letter. The billboard calls for Accenture CEO Julie Sweet to “stop exploiting your workers,” considering how much Accenture is paid compared to how much content moderators make per hour. Ukrainian and Spanish language moderators are also excluded from the $2 premium that bilingual moderators receive. Despite the demand for equal pay in June, there was no change. Moreover, the moderators’ work is emotionally and mentally taxing because of the unpleasant content they moderate. Accenture only offers access to behavioral coaches instead of professional psychological care, according to Foxglove Legal.

Notably, there was a recent court ruling in China’s top court that made “996” culture illegal in August, but the practice is still used.

Environmental advocates, labor groups, and small business owners also participated. They held a press conference on October 6 to protest. Protestors wanted to be part of the decision-making process, and they were worried about pollution and negative impacts on the local economy. Others worry about the working conditions of the new jobs, considering Amazon’s history and how the mega-hub could depress local wages. Officials have said the deal would bring more revenue into the area while also providing opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses.

Workers demanded the company to provide motorcycles or pay a 15% additional allowance, pay for the fuel, add protection measures, and allow collective bargaining. eFood also faced social media backlash, even before the strike. The campaign #cancel_efood went viral, and thousands of customers deleted the app and rated the app poorly on the Google Play store. Riders of Wolt, another big food delivery platform, and other workers’ unions expressed solidarity through a protest meeting. eFood has since then announced it would make all contract workers into direct hires. The day after the announcement, the delivery workers held a 24-hour strike as planned.

The demands include: (1) “Instacart shoppers must be paid by order, and not by batch,” (2) “Instacart must re-introduce item commission,” (3) “Instacart’s rating system can no longer unfairly punish shoppers for issues outside their control,” (4) “occupational death benefits,” (5) and “default tip must be raised to at least 10% for every single order.”

    After news from The Guardian that Google had been illegally underpaying their Temps, Vendors, and Contractors (TVCs) despite pay parity laws in European and Asian countries, over 900 Google employees and subcontractors have signed a petition calling for Google to amend their exploitation of TVCs. They are demanding for Google to repay the TVCs, create a path towards permanent employment, and end its two-tiered perma-temp system. This letter was organized by the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU). Google has acknowledged these issues but hasn’t commented directly on the petition.

HelloFresh management has also been unresponsive towards workers after a COVID-19 outbreak in a Richmond facility. UNITE HERE filed a petition to NLRB to authorize a vote to unionize. In response, anti-union consultants, such as Kulture Consulting, were reported to have held mandatory anti-union meetings. Update: as of 11/23/2021, Workers at the HelloFresh Aurora facility voted 166-to-91 against union organizing.

Programmers have also created and released scripts for others to automatically generate fake reports. The website responded by adding a new version of a Captcha to filter out bot reports. Furthermore, some Twitter users called for a boycott of GoDaddy, the company that hosts the website, as the website violates GoDaddy’s terms of service. In response, GoDaddy gave the website 24 hours to move to another provider before cutting off service.

    Over the summer of 2021, a female employee at Alibaba was sexually assaulted by her supervisor after a business meeting where she was expected to drink. The incident became known as the Alibaba incident, or 807--August 7th--which was the date when the victim posted an essay that detailed the night she was sexually assaulted. In her post, she also talked about how, after the incident, she demanded that the perpetrator be fired from Alibaba, but her superiors at the company protected him. 

After the essay was published, over 6000 employees joined a discussion group to support the victim. On August 8th, they posted a set of recommendations to the company. The post was titled "Aliren for Aliren" ("ren" means "people", so this can be read "Ali-people for Ali-people"). The post critiqued the lack of protection of women employee's rights and the incompetency of upper management for not being able to help the victim.  

The recommendations included giving the victim a paid vacation to emotionally and physically recover from the incident, compensating the victim for her injuries, providing the victim and her family with the necessary counseling/therapy, making the investigation process transparent, providing better training and support to combat sexual harassment and discrimination at the workplace, and reforming HR to better serve the needs of employees (and not just management).

On the day of the strike, many workers posted online via Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit voicing their struggles.

    At Google, a group of Jewish employees (Jewish Diaspora in Tech) is asking the company to support Palestinians during the Israeli bombing campaign in Gaza. An internal letter was circulated among employees asking Sundar Pichai to make a statement condemning recent Israeli attacks on Gaza. The letter mentions accepting the requests of Palestinian Googlers and funding relief for Palestinians affected by the violence, as well as protecting freedom of speech within the company. This new group was formed because some Jewish employees felt that the official Jewish ERG didn't allow a safe place to express anti-Zionist beliefs.

    Interns in Google's BOLD internship program, Tyrese Thomas and Jacob Ngai created a petition with the help of the Alphabet Workers Union. The petition asked Google to provide a $5,000 stipend for costs such as rent and other basic needs for their job. Typically, Google covers these costs with an $11,000 relocation stipend. However, due to COVID-19, the stipend wasn't instated because interns would work remotely from home. Interns argued, however, that those from lower income backgrounds might need additional funding to find office space during the day or to cover the costs of childcare. Overall, the petition gathered 1500 signatures from interns and Google employees. Google gave the interns a $5,000 stipend to spend on what they deem necessary.

Google, Modis (the contracting firm), and the AWU reached a settlement and had Wait's suspension overturned.

    Glitch workers signed a collective bargaining agreement with company management that will last for 11 months. According to a press release from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), this is the first agreement signed by white collar tech workers in the United States. The agreement did not include a call for higher wages because workers recognized that they are paid relatively high wages and that the company has faced economic pressures as a result of the pandemic. Instead, the contract improved job stability, ensuring "just cause" protections against firing and recall rights (priority for re-hiring for the same positions) for workers laid off due to the pandemic.

    The ACM Conference for Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT) organizers have decided not to continue their sponsorship with Google this year. Several press publications have noted the decision to drop Google follows the company's recent decision to fire Ethical AI co-leaders, Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell. The conference's Executive Committee said they chose not to continue their relationship because they it does not align with their Strategic Plan, the goals outlined and agreed upon to guide the FAccT. Gebru was a cofounder of the organization and continues to advise the group. Mitchell is a program co-chair of the conference and a FAccT program committee member.

One of the law firms representing South African drivers also represented UK drivers in front of the UK Supreme Court, which ruled on February 19th that drivers must be classified as employees rather than independent contractors in the country.

    DoorDash drivers are leveraging an old Android version of the DoorDash app to strategically select deliveries and make more money on the platform. Drivers are also organizing online through a movement called #DeclineNow where they follow a strict set of rules to not accept any deliveries that would result in less pay for their time, resources, and gas. A gig worker, Amy Lee, ran an analysis and found that DoorDashers who accept every order are at a stark disadvantage make significantly less an hour than those who selective accept deliveries. Lee has written her own open letter addressing the inefficiencies regarding the pay structure of the app so that it can become a more sustainable job for drivers.

According to the union website, the goal of the AWU is "to create a democratic process for workers to wield decision-making power; promote social, economic, and environmental justice; and end the unfair disparities between TVCs (temporary, vendor, and contractor workers) and FTEs (full-time employees)". The union has been over a year in the making and organizers credit the foundation laid by the last decade of collective actions at the company.

    A court in Bologna, Italy upheld a lawsuit filed by a group of Deliveroo workers, backed by Italy's CGIL union. The lawsuit alleged that Deliveroo's algorithms discriminated against gig workers. The company used machine learning algorithms to determine the "reliability" of a worker and give them preference for certain shifts. The court ruled that the company failed to take valid reasons for cancellation into account, such as medical illness. Legal experts say this could be an important precedent in holding companies responsible for algorithms that cause inadvertent harm.

Those who refused the transfer would be fired, and workers fired for refusing the offer wouldn't be eligible for their share of finders' fee commission usually shared between recruitment agencies and workers.

Unions representing tens of thousands of Amazon.com Inc. employees walked out during the year's busiest shopping season, in protest of Amazon's handling of everything from sick pay and COVID-19 precautions to user privacy. The giant Verdi trade union in Germany is holding a walkout across seven Amazon facilities. Garment workers in Bangladesh will call for higher pay outside an Amazon supplier facility in Dhaka. In Australia, unions will perform “health and safety” inspections of the company’s facilities using their “statutory right of entry,” the campaign said. Others will project the campaign’s logo on buildings in Brussels, London, Sao Paulo and other cities. In all, the organizations participating in the protests represent roughly 40,000 Amazon employees, according to a spokesman for the UNI Global Union. These actions are part of the Make Amazon Pay campaign.

The campaign also tasks Amazon with “committing to zero emissions by 2030” and paying back society by “ending partnerships with police forces and immigration authorities that are institutionally racist” and “paying taxes in full, in the countries where the real economic activity takes place.” The campaign was run by Progressive International, and had the support of the Amazon Workers International, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the Tech Workers Coalition, Athena, and many more.

    A group of California Uber drivers sued the company for asking drivers to support Prop. 22 (a state proposition that would overrule attempts to classify gig workers as employees) through in-app messaging. The suit seeks an injunction that would stop the messages. The plaintiffs were active in the movement against Prop. 22. They claimed that the company's message that 72% of its drivers support Prop. 22 was false because that percentage was the result of company pressures (including workers' concerns that the company was surveilling their survey answers on the app).

Accenture, which hired the moderators as contractors, informed them on October 1st that they would have to return to their office in Austin, Texas. A Facebook spokesperson said the reason for the return was that "some of the most sensitive content can’t be reviewed from home".

Workers also called for consumers to boycott the service. Shipt has more than 100,000 workers in the U.S. and is used by companies such as Target. Willy Solis, from the Gig Workers Collective, was the lead organizer for the event and used social media groups and word-of-mouth (encouraging each committed worker to recruit five additional participants) to drive the strike.

    Thousands of delivery workers have engaged in a strike on Wednesday demanding better working conditions in more than 10 Brazilian capitals, as well as in cities in Argentina and Mexico. This was spurred by lack of health benefits in light of the covid-19 pandemic. The workers organized themselves outside the unions with broad popular support as they spread their movement through the internet using the hashtags #BrequeDosApps (brake the apps) and #YoNoReparto (I won’t deliver). Besides the risk of being exposed to the virus, workers report long working hours—often more than 14 hours a day—for increasingly low pay, without health insurance or labor rights.

    Contract workers for Facebook in Austin, Texas, say they have been retaliated against for union organizing, resulting in two workers’ departure in recent weeks. The workers, who help Facebook find and triage internal bugs, are unhappy with their employer, the India-based firm WiPro, and have been organizing in the workplace to pressure both companies for improvements. Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE). The organization is especially interested in organizing workers who, like the Austin-based contingent Facebook workers, perform work for major tech firms but aren’t directly employed by them.

'Uber, Lyft and other gig companies are continuing in the same path of abusing and completely taking advantage of workers while putting them at risk,' rideshare driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising Edan Alva told TechCrunch. This protest comes shortly after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.

In late April, Amazon announced that it would end its unlimited unpaid leave policy on May 1. The policy, which was introduced in response to COVID-19, allowed workers to call out sick without penalty. As of Wednesday, more than 5,300 workers from 350 locations, including Amazon warehouses, delivery pick-up stations, and Whole Foods stores, had signed onto petitions. The action was organized by a number of labor groups including the Athena coalition.

    Hundreds of thousands of writers signed to China Literature (subsidiary of Tencent), the country's biggest online publisher, went on an online strike, protesting against exploitative contracts and the company's regular infringement of their intellectual property rights. The strike's organizers were demonstrating against proposed changes to China Literature’s business model and contracts with its writers. Writers stopped publishing new content on the website on the day of the strike. This change would negatively affect writers' income, which primarily comes from subscription fees and tips from their readers. 'Financially speaking, we were already drowning in quicksand before the rumors. Now they are trying to give us a death blow' a China Literature writer

    Amazon has been sued by workers at two different locations, New York City and Salem, Oregon, for its failure to protect its employees during the coronavirus pandemic. Three Amazon employees from the New York fulfillment center sued the company for failing to follow local public health guidance, claiming the company purposefully miscommunicated with workers. The employees are not seeking compensation, only an order that Amazon comply with guidance. A former employee from Salem alleged that she was fired after taking a medical leave for a coronavirus infection and speaking out publicly about safety issues.

The Washington Post reports that "a small crowd" outside of an Amazon Staten Island warehouse was made up of Amazon workers and also healthcare professionals who appeared out of solidarity with their cause. The scale of the action is difficult to measure, given its broad geography. Walkouts and protests were reported in Atlanta, New York, and the Bay Area.

    Amazon employees went on strike after the company allegedly fired a worker who chose to stay at home with her two children during the pandemic. Workers also protested the company's announcement that it would phase out their new paid-leave policy on May 1st. The company announced that two more employees had tested positive for the virus the night before the protest. Reporting from Vice and a tweet from a local community center suggest that this also served as impetus for the strike. Organizers claimed that more than 50 employees were involved in the strike, while management claimed it was 25.

The memo notes that some Google contractors, like those in the company’s Pittsburgh office employed by an independent company called HCL Technologies, have been forced to come into the office, even as full-time Google employees were first allowed and then instructed to stay home.

The move comes after 90% of the workers indicated their support for joining CWA and authorized CWA to be their bargaining representative. Glitch will join the CWA Local 1101, as part of the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA) initiative, which was launched back in January.

The baristas claim that Slack caught wind of their intention to criticize the company publicly—and in what they claim to be an organizing victory, they learned that their severance would be extended to 90 days.

    Gig Workers Rising launched a petition calling on the heads of the biggest gig economy platforms to give workers paid sick leave amid the coronavirus outbreak. That petition garnered more than 900 signatures. In the petition, the workers say they are often on the “front lines of exposure,” given that every day they come in contact with various people, including those arriving at airports or heading to the hospital. Without paid sick leave, the gig workers say they are often forced to choose between making ends meet and taking care of their health, and therefore the health of the company's customers.

Amazon workers in New York City have started an online petition on coworker.org to advocate for paid time off, paid sick leave, and a process to appeal final warnings. Over 1,200 people have signed the petition. Workers at the Skokie, Illinois facility have written a letter to management and are circulating a petition demanding backdated paid time off. Though many workers log more than 20 hours a week, they are still recognized as part-time employees of the company. These events follow similar actions taken by Amazon workers in Sacramento late in 2019.

    Members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice submitted comments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against a new regulation that would prevent smaller shareholders from proposing shareholder resolutions (i.e. proposals to change how a company is run). Under the new rules, shareholders would have to presently hold at least $25,000 worth of shares or have held $2,000 worth of shares continuously for the last three years. The group has argued that this prevents smaller shareholders from voicing their opinion. Included in this group are many recently hired tech employees with small caches of employer stock. While shareholder resolutions are not binding, they have had some success in pushing corporations towards taking a stance on social issues such as gender equity.

Notably, all quotes included employee name and company title. Some quotes touched on other ethical issues in addition to climate change, such as the company's contracts with ICE. The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics. Update: Quotations received from 400 employees.

These workers — who say they lift hundreds of packages a day in “back-breaking” labor —currently receive zero PTO days a year. The walkout comes weeks after workers say management has ignored their requests to meet with leaders of a group organizing around the issue. So far, workers have circulated an internal and public petition gaining over 4,000 signatures in total.

By Sunday, more than 200 workers had signed a petition requesting an explanation for why they receive fewer paid days off per year than typical Amazon warehouse workers. The workers, who call themselves Amazonians United Sacramento, say that unlike other Amazon employees, they receive no paid time off. These workers, who sort and prepare packages for final-mile delivery in a station called DSM1, said they were told by Amazon managers that they get less paid time off (PTO) because they are classified by the company as Class Q workers. The Sacramento employees said they were previously unaware of any such classification.

    A group of roughly 200 Googler and other protesters rallied outside of the search giant’s offices in San Francisco on Friday, demanding the company reinstate two colleagues who they say were unjustly punished for workplace organizing at the company — calling it an attack on accountability and transparency in tech. Google has said the employees were placed on administrative leave for violating company policies about accessing sensitive internal documents and monitoring employees’ calendar events. They accuse management of targeting Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland, because of their involvement in worker activism at the company. Rivers helped put together a petition against Google’s work for US immigration enforcement agency Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and Berland was involved with employee protests about hate speech policies on YouTube. Protesters are demanding that Rivers and Berland be reinstated at work immediately. Organizers called their suspension an “attempt to silence workers,” in an email about the rally.

    About 2,300 Google cafeteria workers (contracted through Compass) voted to unionize to call for better pay and benefits. These workers include dishwashers and food preparers who serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner to Google employees. The service workers are considered contract workers and don't receive the same benefits such as retirement plans which are standard for direct Google employees. The cafeteria workers voted to unionize with a local chapter of Unite Here, which represents 300,000 workers in food, casino, laundry, hotel, and warehouse industries. Workers expressed dissatisfaction with their low wages, which start at $35,000 in the Bay Area, and lack of benefits compared to full-time Google employees. Some reported incidents of discrimination and bullying. The workers are officially employed by Compass Group, a third party contractor. The vote followed a two year effort.

    Google employees held a protest in San Francisco days before the company ended its long-held TGIF meetings, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. Some 20 people organized at Google's office in downtown San Francisco to protest the company placing Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland on sudden and indefinite administrative leave the prior week, the memo states. Authors of the memo, which was circulated internally at Google on Monday, claimed the actions were an act of retaliation against the workers.

Just before the annual conference, 5 Githubbers left the company, citing Github's involvement with ICE.

But we want our time here to have meant something' the group said in its letter. A software engineer at WeWork who is helping to organise the WeWorkers Coalition, said 185 people had signed the letter to management, while at least 600 expressed an interest in joining ahead of the group publicising its launch this week. The coalition wants cleaners and maintenance staff to receive full benefits and fair pay.

    Uber drivers filed an injunction to classify workers as employees and to compensate them for overtime pay, paid sick leave and reimbursement for business expenses. On September 17, Lyft drivers filed a similar injunction. Update: New motions have been added to the injunction in March 2020 in light of the coronavirus outbreak. On March 20, 2020, a Massachusetts federal judge ruled that the companies would not be required to classify their drivers as employees.

    Over 1700 Amazon employees have signed an internal petition pledging to walk out over their employer's lack of action on climate change. The demonstration, scheduled to start at 11:30 am Pacific time on September 20, will mark the first time in Amazon’s 25-year history that workers at its Seattle headquarters have walked off the job, though many are taking paid vacation to do so. Most of the workers who have signed on so far work in Seattle, but employees in other offices, including in Europe, have indicated an interest in the event as well. The protest is part of a global general strike on September 20th 2019.

Published on Medium, the letter documents a variety of micro- and full-blown aggressions employees say they have endured over the last year from managers, HR, and their white colleagues. The memo was co-written by 12 current employees, including black, Latinx, and Asian women workers. One program manager describes being told by two white employees to 'clean up after their mess' at breakfast. When the program manager flagged the incident for their supervisor, they were told to 'dress more professionally.'

The striking riders are organised in what used to be the Norwegian Transport Workers' Union, which is now part of Fellesforbundet. The strike has already had consequences for Foodora. The employees demand higher salaries and compensation for expenses incurred using their own private bikes at work. The striking riders cycle around Oslo every day in what they call Critical Mass, something that demonstrates the strike is ongoing and that it is growing day by day. The strike lasted 5 weeks.

    Google contract workers in Pittsburgh voted to unionize and petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to set up a representation election. Two-thirds of the workers, formally employed by HCL America, were in favor of the action. United Steelworkers helped to organize the union drive through their Pittsburgh Association of Tech Professionals (PATP) project. News outlets report that this is the first successful unionization of white-collar tech contractors. Workers intend to use their position to bargain for compensation, benefits, and job security comparable to Google employees. Google currently employs more contract workers (135,000) than direct Google employees (115,000) according to the Guardian. A group of Google employees have signed a letter of support and others have published a petition calling for the company to sign a neutrality agreement and abstain from union-busting tactics.

An application by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers was filed last week with the Ontario Labour Relations Board, months after a campaign was launched that addressed working conditions. The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was pulling out of the Canadian market.

    In Nairobi, subcontracted Facebook content moderators employed by Sama face poor wages and working conditions.

In 2019, more than 100 workers known as The Alliance demanded higher wages, increased transparency about what the job entails, its mental impact, and better working conditions in a petition to management, with a threat to strike. As a result, some workers were suspended.  Sama also allegedly threatened the employees to remove their signatures from the petition by emphasizing that they were replaceable. Daniel Motaung, a key organizer, worked to establish The Alliance as a union but was fired.

Since then, Sama has improved the transparency of the role in their onboarding program. No strike or unionization has happened.

During the pandemic, many content moderators requested sick leave. However, unless they had a not from a specific hospital, HR didn’t grant sick leave. As a result, many continued going to the office, even if they had symptoms.

The campaign is calling for greater transparency into YouTube's monetization policy, individual responses to queries about videos that have been taken down by the site, creation of an independent mediation board, and formal representation from content creators in the company's decision-making process. In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so. YouTubers Union is designed to serve as a union for YouTube content creators and has over 20,000 Facebook members as of August 9th, 2019 but it is not clear how many are actively involved in the campaign. It does not require dues from its members.

    Hundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers from the Bay Area traveled to Sacramento to persuade legislators to vote in favor of Assembly Bill 5. This piece of legislation would require rideshare companies to extend employee benefits to their drivers, who are currently classified as independent contractors. Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.

    A group of more than 30 Microsoft employees is lobbying coworkers to stop donating to the company's political action committee in an effort to starve the PAC of funds. While Microsoft pitches itself as an inclusive and progressive company — especially during Pride Month, with tweets and donations to LGBTQ+ causes — employees who have donated to the PAC say they have no control over which candidates are being supported, meaning that they have no say when the PAC financially supports bigoted candidates. On July 2019, Microsoft has temporarily halted political donations through its political action committee after facing this backlash from employees.

An employee referred to the Oracle co-founder's interview with Fox Business last October, in which Larry Ellison said that 'we [the US] have a serious competition going with China, I’m on Team USA', and 'if we let China produce more engineers than we do, if we let China's technology companies beat our technology companies, it won't be long that our military is behind technologically also'.

    Earlier this year, a group of influential software engineers in Google’s cloud division, referred to as the 'Group of Nine', surprised their superiors by refusing to work on a cutting-edge security feature. Known as “air gap,” the technology would have helped Google win sensitive military contracts. The coders weren’t persuaded their employer should be using its technological might to help the government wage war, according to four current and former employees. After hearing the engineers’ objections, Urs Hölzle, Google’s top technical executive, said the air gap feature would be postponed, one of the people said.

    Nearly one hundred Didi drivers gathered in front of the company office in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, on 8 June protesting its new “guarantee scheme.” The scheme, rolled out in April, claimed to provide drivers with a stable income but required them to work at least ten hours a day. Didi then gradually reduced the orders for those drivers who refused to join the new scheme, sparking anger among drivers who wanted to maintain a more flexible work schedule. One driver said his income had fallen by 5,000 yuan as a result of the new system.

    Workers of Oracle Korea sat outside the main office for more than 50 days after 19 negotiations with the management from December to April failed. This is now the longest strike by employees of a foreign IT companies in Korea. 'Some people think we don't need a union because they believe we work at a leading global IT companies and have well-paid jobs,' Kim Chul-soo, president of the Oracle labor union, said. 'It's not true at all.' Workers are suffering from a decline in real wages because there has been no increase in basic salary for the last 10 years, while half of the salary is based on incentives. Hiring scams similar to those at local banks, along with sexual harassment are also among the union’s accusations.

    After trialling a new payment model, which Deliveroo claims has been a success, the company will begin paying riders a fixed fee per deliver of £3.75 rather than the current hourly rate of £7 per hour plus £1 per delivery. This has left some of Deliveroo’s  couriers unhappy enough to hold something akin to a strike. Outside the Deliveroo headquarters more than 100 self-employed workers gathered calling for the company to keep the hourly rate.

    Uber settled two class-action lawsuits that argued independent contractors should be classified as company employees. Uber agreed to pay drivers $84 million (and an additional $16 million upon IPO and pending increased valuation). Drivers were allowed to form associations in California and Massachusetts and see the data behind their rating. In later months, more than 150 drivers called for the judge to vacate the settlement.

In 2017, Instacart won a small victory — the grocery-on-demand startup just settled a class action lawsuit to the tune of $4.6 million.

The group pressured the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to adopt an anti-war position and NYC members collected 320 signatures on petitions against the military's use of technology. They raised funds to pay for the bail of a fellow programmer, Clark Squire, who was arrested for his activity with the Black Panthers. The group also attended an event at NYU to support work and research stoppages in universities.
