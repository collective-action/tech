[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jianshentan/collective-actions-in-tech/_apis/build/status/organizejs.collective-actions-in-tech?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jianshentan/collective-actions-in-tech/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

This repository is an attempt to document all collective actions from workers in the tech industry.

For the purposes of this project, the tech industry is defined to include any companies whose core business is information technology. We are excluding adjacent industries such as gaming and digital media.

The goal of _Collective Action in Tech_ is to give us, tech workers, insights on trends in worker power in the tech industry. This archive is meant to provide us with the data to  find the connections between different struggless and to let us reflect collectively on moments in tech labor.

**This repository is meant to be a live document. We need your help to ensure its accuracy and completeness! See the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how to contribute.**

    Google workers stage a sit-in on May Day, following allegations of retaliation from the company against employees who participated in walkouts last year. "Googlers from around the world gathered at 11am local time to sit together and show retaliation is #NotOkGoogle. The stories we've been collecting will be shared, demands will be read, and all will be in solidarity with those withstanding this chilling practice."

    Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton held a town hall for Google workers to discuss the retaliation they have faced from management for engaging in organizing, and to share more than a dozen other stories of retaliation they have gathered. The meeting was held in New York but live-streamed to Google offices elsewhere. This action involved hundreds of workers.

    Instagram memers have had enough. They generate the engagement that helps keep Instagram growingâ€”but, they argue, the multibillion-dollar platform doesn't pay them for their work, or give them any control. So they're fighting back. And before you write off IG Meme Union Local 69-420 as a joke, the organizers of the collective would like you to know that they are very serious.

    A group of Microsoft employees appeared at an employee meeting with CEO Satya Nadella Thursday to protest the companies's treatment of women. It's not clear how many were part of the protest, but some female and male employees at the event wore all white, inspired by the congresswomen who wore suffragette white to the State of the Union in February.

    Google employees have signed an open letter published Tuesday on Medium demanding that the companies cease work on Project Dragonfly, which is aimed at creating a search engine that the Chinese government would be able to control to censor certain results and surveil users. "International human rights organizations and investigative reporters have also sounded the alarm, emphasizing serious human rights concerns and repeatedly calling on Google to cancel the project," the letter reads in part. "So far, our leadership's response has been unsatisfactory."

    A group of Instacart delivery workers is waging an ongoing "soft strike" against the companies to demand better pay this Thanksgiving weekend for the third year in a row. The workers, who are independent contractors, say a recent change to the grocery delivery platform's pay structure was an effective pay cut thatâ€™s threatening their livelihoods. As a result, theyâ€™re refusing to deliver extra-heavy items, drive more than eight miles per order, or accept time-consuming, low-paying jobs. A group of delivery workers wrote  a letter sent to Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta. The letter currently has more than 1,300 signatures on Change.org.

Workers contracted to food delivery giant Meituan in the northern city of Taiyuan staged a work stoppage in protest at a wide range of issues including pay levels, delivery times, insurance and high accident rates.

    Workers of Oracle Korea have been sat outside the main office for more than 50 days after 19 negotiations with the management from December to April failed. This is now the longest strike by employees of a foreign IT companies in Korea. "Some people think we don't need a union because they believe we work at a leading global IT companies and have well-paid jobs," Kim Chul-soo, president of the Oracle labor union, said. "It's not true at all." Workers are suffering from a decline in real wages because there has been no increase in basic salary for the last 10 years, while half of the salary is based on incentives. Hiring scams similar to those at local banks, along with sexual harassment are also among the unionâ€™s accusations.
