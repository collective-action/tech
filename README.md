    Data center temps who work for Modis, a Google subcontractor, were promised $200 weekly incentive bonuses because of the pandemic. After Modis stopped this program and announced that workers would not receive back pay, the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA workers began organization efforts. Workers filed “tickets” to Modis' management, sent more than 100 messages, and arranged a videoconference. There were also discussions of a work stoppage. Before the scheduled videoconference, however, Modis backtracked their decision in an email. Modis agreed to continue paying the hazard pay until December 19.

    More than 2,000 Amazon workers in Staten Island filed the petition to the NLRB to hold a union election. This effort, led by Chris Smalls and is called the Amazon labor Union. Smalls, a former employee, was fired after organizing a protest for lack of COVID protective gear and poor hazard pay. As an independent union, they hope to avoid Amazon’s anti-union messaging targeted towards established unions. The Amazon Labor Union has begun a union drive. Its goals are to bring back variable compensation pay and stock options that Amazon removed in 2018. In response, Amazon questioned if there was a sufficient number of legitimate signatures from Amazon employees.  Amazon has also taken anti-union tactics, such as displaying anti-union messages in their facilities and bringing in anti-union consultants.

    Employees walked out of a Netflix building in Los Angeles to protest Dave Chappelle’s special, joining supporters and activists who were already rallying. Other Netflix employees stopped working that day as a virtual walkout. #NetflixWalkOut also trended on Twitter. In response, Netflix issued a statement expressing support of the walkout while also remaining supportive of Chappelle.

    With the backing of Foxglove Legal, Facebook contract moderators at Accenture are protesting low wages with a mobile billboard and internal letter. The billboard calls for Accenture CEO Julie Sweet to “stop exploiting your workers,” considering how much Accenture is paid compared to how much content moderators make per hour. Ukrainian and Spanish language moderators are also excluded from the $2 premium that bilingual moderators receive. Despite the demand for equal pay in June, there was no change. Moreover, the moderators’ work is emotionally and mentally taxing because of the unpleasant content they moderate. Accenture only offers access to behavioral coaches instead of professional psychological care, according to Foxglove Legal.

    In response to Dave Chappelle's controversial Netflix special,  Netflix trans employee resource group has released a list of demands and organized a walkout for October 20th. The demands are increased internal conversations about potentially harmful content, the hiring of trans and nonbinary executives, and removing transphobic content in the office; it notably does not include removing Chappelle’s special from Netflix. Also, a leader of the trans-ERG was fired from Netflix because the company concluded that she leaked confidential information.

    Uber drivers, organized by the Croatian Digital Platform Workers’ Union, held a strike and press conference in Croatia. They claimed that their salaries were not paid in time with no explanation. Despite Uber portraying drivers as partners, the workers feel like “digital slaves” who cannot get in contact with Uber’s authorities.

    Four anonymous creators started the “Worker Lives Matter” campaign, in which employees of Chinese tech companies log their working hours in a GitHub spreadsheet to protest the “996” working overtime culture. They hope to popularize the “955” instead and have GitHub serve as a reference tool for job seekers. Notably, there was a recent court ruling in China’s top court that made “996” culture illegal in August, but the practice is still used. As of October 28, the official account and website have been permanently banned, and so the project has been suspended. A backup of GitHub data is still available to view.

    Amazon had plans to build a new Amazon “mega-hub” at Newark Liberty International Airport, drawing resistance from Amazon warehouse workers, some of which were Teamster members. Environmental advocates, labor groups, and small business owners also participated. They held a press conference on October 6 to protest. Protestors wanted to be part of the decision-making process, and they were worried about pollution and negative impacts on the local economy. Others worry about the working conditions of the new jobs, considering Amazon’s history and how the mega-hub could depress local wages. Officials have said the deal would bring more revenue into the area while also providing opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses.

    In response to recent strikes that protested unfair working conditions, Gorillas fired “several dozen Berlin-based delivery workers.” In response, the Gorillas Workers Collective called for a protest in front of the company’s headquarters. Gorillas have said that these strikes were unannounced, non-unionized, spontaneous, and are illegal under German law. However, other workers have shown screenshots of schedules that violate German labor law.  After the strikes took place, the company reportedly replaced those striking with Zenjob gig workers from Bermannkiez.

Moreover, the letter brings up environmental issues; Blue Origin operates with no consideration of its environmental footprint or permits needed for waste. Smith has responded with a letter that says that the company would “reflect” on ways of improvement and that it has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment. He also emphasized that the vehicle was properly certified for First Human Flight.

    After the online food platform eFood announced that it will change its contract-based workers into freelancers, it sparked a strike and motor-march by its workers. Workers demanded the company to provide motorcycles or pay a 15% additional allowance, pay for the fuel, add protection measures, and allow collective bargaining. eFood also faced social media backlash, even before the strike. The campaign #cancel_efood went viral, and thousands of customers deleted the app and rated the app poorly on the Google Play store. Riders of Wolt, another big food delivery platform, and other workers’ unions expressed solidarity through a protest meeting. eFood has since then announced it would make all contract workers into direct hires. The day after the announcement, the delivery workers held a 24-hour strike as planned.

On the 28th, Uber drivers didn’t log on, and passengers were encouraged to stop using the service or book services. Employees protested about being unfairly dismissed as well as the company failing to pay for waiting time, despite a UK Supreme Court ruling. It is also a protest against the newly introduced fixed price fares. The strike occurred in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, and Nottingham.

Despite a CEO change, Instacart has not changed its practices, so Gig Workers Collective calls on Instacart’s customers to delete the app and support the Collective’s demands with the hashtag #DELETEINSTACART. The demands include: (1) “Instacart shoppers must be paid by order, and not by batch,” (2) “Instacart must re-introduce item commission,” (3) “Instacart’s rating system can no longer unfairly punish shoppers for issues outside their control,” (4) “occupational death benefits,” (5) and “default tip must be raised to at least 10% for every single order.”

    After news from The Guardian that Google had been illegally underpaying their Temps, Vendors, and Contractors (TVCs) despite pay parity laws in European and Asian countries, over 900 Google employees and subcontractors have signed a petition calling for Google to amend their exploitation of TVCs. They are demanding for Google to repay the TVCs, create a path towards permanent employment, and end its two-tiered perma-temp system. This letter was organized by the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU). Google has acknowledged these issues but hasn’t commented directly on the petition.

DoorDash had recently blocked access to an app called Para that allowed workers to see the tip amount before accepting an order. Organizing for the strike began with online posts to Reddit. On the day of the strike, many workers posted online via Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit voicing their struggles.

    An open letter was published demanding justice for Jessica (Ming) Tao, a former employee at Google. According to the open letter, "Google has chosen to put Jessica on unpaid leave while her rapist is still fully employed." The letter states that this is a common practice where Google protects the harasser instead of the victim. The letter demands that Jessica is compensated in full for her time on disability leave. The letter demands, "that survivors involved in future proceedings are always compensated for their time during this traumatizing process." Lastly, the letter demands Alphabet to stop having workers go to employee assistance program (EAP) therapy when they face harassment or other workplace abuses.

These actions were taken because a transgender man, Phares Lee, requested to have his deadname replaced by his preferred name. His request was denied and he was forced to put his legal name. Lee works for G4S, a Google contractor, and was also banned from participating in employee resource groups (ERGs) as a result of his contractor status. The petition also called on the company to open ERGs to contractors. Update (6/14): G4S and Google allowed Phares to use his preferred name and join Google ERGs.

    Interns in Google's BOLD internship program, Tyrese Thomas and Jacob Ngai created a petition with the help of the Alphabet Workers Union. The petition asked Google to provide a $5,000 stipend for costs such as rent and other basic needs for their job. Typically, Google covers these costs with an $11,000 relocation stipend. However, due to COVID-19, the stipend wasn't instated because interns would work remotely from home. Interns argued, however, that those from lower income backgrounds might need additional funding to find office space during the day or to cover the costs of childcare. Overall, the petition gathered 1500 signatures from interns and Google employees. Google gave the interns a $5,000 stipend to spend on what they deem necessary.

    DoorDash drivers are working together with a 40,000 person online community (#DeclineNow) to increase their pay by systematically declining orders through the platform. As part of the #DeclineNow movement, DoorDash drivers do not accept orders that pay less than $7, more than twice the current $3 floor. By collectively declining orders, it forces the algorithm to offer the next driver the same delivery but at a higher price.

    In February, the Alphabet Worker's Union filed two lawsuits against Google for unfair labor practices on behalf of Shannon Wait, a contractor at Google and member of the union. The first lawsuit contested Wait's illegal suspension for supporting a union. The second lawsuit alleged that managers illegally asked Wait and other employees not to discuss their wages. Google, Modis (the contracting firm), and the AWU reached a settlement and had Wait's suspension overturned. Google signed a document that its employees had the right to discuss wage, bonuses, and working conditions. This is the first NLRB settlement with the AWU.

According to a press release from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), this is the first agreement signed by white collar tech workers in the United States. The agreement did not include a call for higher wages because workers recognized that they are paid relatively high wages and that the company has faced economic pressures as a result of the pandemic. Instead, the contract improved job stability, ensuring "just cause" protections against firing and recall rights (priority for re-hiring for the same positions) for workers laid off due to the pandemic.

Drivers are also organizing online through a movement called #DeclineNow where they follow a strict set of rules to not accept any deliveries that would result in less pay for their time, resources, and gas. A gig worker, Amy Lee, ran an analysis and found that DoorDashers who accept every order are at a stark disadvantage make significantly less an hour than those who selective accept deliveries. Lee has written her own open letter addressing the inefficiencies regarding the pay structure of the app so that it can become a more sustainable job for drivers.

The union has been over a year in the making and organizers credit the foundation laid by the last decade of collective actions at the company.

The company used machine learning algorithms to determine the "reliability" of a worker and give them preference for certain shifts. The court ruled that the company failed to take valid reasons for cancellation into account, such as medical illness. Legal experts say this could be an important precedent in holding companies responsible for algorithms that cause inadvertent harm.

Those who refused the transfer would be fired, and workers fired for refusing the offer wouldn't be eligible for their share of finders' fee commission usually shared between recruitment agencies and workers.

The strike was called to push for recognition of the union's collective agreements and paying employees according to those agreements. Verdi is also pressuring Amazon for better health and safety conditions.

The union at Gimlet, a major podcast publisher that was bought by Spotify last year for $230 million, is joining unions at The Ringer and Parcast—all properties owned by Spotify—in the work stoppage. The union's demands have included a contract with guaranteed raises, clear guidelines surrounding promotions, the right to profit from intellectual property they help create, a greater emphasis on diversity, and pay equity across the board. The work stoppage was streamed on Twitch for a little over an hour, with organizing members from all three groups outlining in detail their demands.

    Thousands of Amazon workers walk off the job to fight for fair pay and COVID protections. Unions representing tens of thousands of Amazon.com Inc. employees walked out during the year's busiest shopping season, in protest of Amazon's handling of everything from sick pay and COVID-19 precautions to user privacy. The giant Verdi trade union in Germany is holding a walkout across seven Amazon facilities. Garment workers in Bangladesh will call for higher pay outside an Amazon supplier facility in Dhaka. In Australia, unions will perform “health and safety” inspections of the company’s facilities using their “statutory right of entry,” the campaign said. Others will project the campaign’s logo on buildings in Brussels, London, Sao Paulo and other cities. In all, the organizations participating in the protests represent roughly 40,000 Amazon employees, according to a spokesman for the UNI Global Union. These actions are part of the Make Amazon Pay campaign.

They called on the tech giant to provide better working conditions for its employees and to reduce its expanding carbon footprint. Launched on Black Friday, the campaign provides a list of demands for Amazon, which include raising pay for workers in Amazon’s warehouses, extending paid sick leave, and allowing workers to organize in unions. The campaign also tasks Amazon with “committing to zero emissions by 2030” and paying back society by “ending partnerships with police forces and immigration authorities that are institutionally racist” and “paying taxes in full, in the countries where the real economic activity takes place.” The campaign was run by Progressive International, and had the support of the Amazon Workers International, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the Tech Workers Coalition, Athena, and many more.

The suit seeks an injunction that would stop the messages. The plaintiffs were active in the movement against Prop. 22. They claimed that the company's message that 72% of its drivers support Prop. 22 was false because that percentage was the result of company pressures (including workers' concerns that the company was surveilling their survey answers on the app).

    Rideshare drivers protested in Abuja, Nigeria, calling for greater government oversight on pricing for apps like Uber and Bolt. Drivers threatened to go on strike within a week's time if the government did not respond to their demands. Drivers noted the disparity in prices between Abuja and other major cities in Nigeria and surrounding countries. Rising gas prices have also led to decreased profits for many drivers. Several organizations were involved: Abuja City Pilot Forum (ACPF), City Online Drivers Association (CODA) and the Online Hackney Practitioners Association of Nigeria (OHPAN).

    24 employees of tech non-profit Do Something walked off the job, calling for the resignation of current CEO Aria Finger. They have also sent two direct letters to the CEO and Board of Directors that have been shared on Twitter. Former employees shared experiences of racial discrimination and harassment via social media earlier this year. The letter states that Finger reacted to these posts by calling them untrue or "standard-issued American forms of microaggression and racism". Finger returned in August after a legal investigation did not find evidence of discrimination under her tenure.

The actions are designed to target companies, e.g. certain restaurants, that workers believe to be part of the exploitation. An outright strike was deemed too expensive by the workers, many of whom report working 60-70 hours a week to make ends meet. Actions will also include flyering and a demonstration.

This was spurred by lack of health benefits in light of the covid-19 pandemic. The workers organized themselves outside the unions with broad popular support as they spread their movement through the internet using the hashtags #BrequeDosApps (brake the apps) and #YoNoReparto (I won’t deliver). Besides the risk of being exposed to the virus, workers report long working hours—often more than 14 hours a day—for increasingly low pay, without health insurance or labor rights.

    Hundreds of Microsoft employees have signed a letter to the company’s top executives asking for Microsoft to take action in the wake of national protests. The initiative came out of a Facebook group called "Young Microsoft FTEs". The email to the Microsoft executives includes a list of requests, including increased leniency for Microsoft workers in performance reviews due to the coronavirus pandemic and protests; the company formally condemning the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs; increasing Microsoft’s employee donation matches; the cancellation of contracts with SPD and other law enforcement agencies; support for defunding the SPD; signing a petition for the resignation of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; and support for a list of demands from BLM Seattle. Employees volunteered to be CC’d on the email in a show of solidarity, though their inclusion was not intended to show explicit support for every request, according to the email.

    Nine current and former Facebook content moderators posted a message of solidarity with the Black community in the wake of the George Floyd protests and in support of the virtual walkout. The authors noted that they would have attended the walkout "if Facebook would allow it. As outsourced contractors, non-disclosure agreements deter us from speaking openly about what we do and witness for most of our waking hours." The workers also remarked on the lack of protections they receive from their employer. "We would walk out with you — if we could afford it. At the moment, content moderators have no possibility, no network or platform or financial security — especially when we are atomized in pandemic and remotely micromanaged — to stage an effective walkout without risking fines, our income and even our right to stay in the countries where we live and work."

    Contract workers for Facebook in Austin, Texas, say they have been retaliated against for union organizing, resulting in two workers’ departure in recent weeks. The workers, who help Facebook find and triage internal bugs, are unhappy with their employer, the India-based firm WiPro, and have been organizing in the workplace to pressure both companies for improvements. Recently, two people involved in the organizing campaign who were vocal about these issues departed the company. Both had posted heated messages on an internal message board about the need to improve conditions for the contingent workers and encouraging remaining staff to support a union drive, and say their departures followed retaliation from WiPro. Since January, the Communication Workers of America (CWA) labor union has been promoting its Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE). The organization is especially interested in organizing workers who, like the Austin-based contingent Facebook workers, perform work for major tech firms but aren’t directly employed by them.

'Uber, Lyft and other gig companies are continuing in the same path of abusing and completely taking advantage of workers while putting them at risk,' rideshare driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising Edan Alva told TechCrunch. This protest comes shortly after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.

    Amazon warehouse workers plan to deliver thousands signed petitions to the residences of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and lead Amazon spokesperson Jay Carney on Thursday, demanding the reinstatement of its recently terminated unlimited paid leave policy. In late April, Amazon announced that it would end its unlimited unpaid leave policy on May 1. The policy, which was introduced in response to COVID-19, allowed workers to call out sick without penalty. As of Wednesday, more than 5,300 workers from 350 locations, including Amazon warehouses, delivery pick-up stations, and Whole Foods stores, had signed onto petitions. The action was organized by a number of labor groups including the Athena coalition.

The employees are not seeking compensation, only an order that Amazon comply with guidance. A former employee from Salem alleged that she was fired after taking a medical leave for a coronavirus infection and speaking out publicly about safety issues.

    Ride-hail drivers in California gathered outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego to demand that gig platforms provide immediate relief to their cash-strapped, at-risk workers, including by adhering to California’s new labor law known as AB5. Drivers are calling on California to enforce its new employment law as illness, confusion, and hardship from COVID-19 sweep their industries. They are also calling for the $110 million set aside by Uber, Lyft, Doordash, Postmates, and Instacart for fighting that law to instead be used to give workers some relief.

A spokesperson for Amazon's French CFDT union estimated that between 30-40% of Amazon employees in the country were no longer showing up to work over safety concerns or because of childcare obligations. A French law requires workplaces to keep paying workers who refuse to work over safety concerns.

They also requested child-care funds for workers with children, increased hazard pay, an end to penalties for working too slowly, and an immediate closure of any facility where a worker tests positive. “While Amazon has made some limited coronavirus accommodations, it needs a comprehensive plan to ensure the safety of all of its workers and the larger public, including giving workers paid leave and not simply extending our unpaid leave, as was announced recently,” the petition states.

Without paid sick leave, the gig workers say they are often forced to choose between making ends meet and taking care of their health, and therefore the health of the company's customers.

    Members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice submitted comments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against a new regulation that would prevent smaller shareholders from proposing shareholder resolutions (i.e. proposals to change how a company is run). Under the new rules, shareholders would have to presently hold at least $25,000 worth of shares or have held $2,000 worth of shares continuously for the last three years. The group has argued that this prevents smaller shareholders from voicing their opinion. Included in this group are many recently hired tech employees with small caches of employer stock. While shareholder resolutions are not binding, they have had some success in pushing corporations towards taking a stance on social issues such as gender equity.

The action violates a company policy that prohibits employees from publicly speaking about the business without prior company approval. The employee group is currently calling for Amazon to go carbon neutral by 2030, to cut ties with fossil fuel companies, and to stop funding politicians and lobbyists who deny climate change. This action is a response to Amazon's previous threats to fire internal critics. Update: Quotations received from 400 employees.

These workers — who say they lift hundreds of packages a day in “back-breaking” labor —currently receive zero PTO days a year. The walkout comes weeks after workers say management has ignored their requests to meet with leaders of a group organizing around the issue. So far, workers have circulated an internal and public petition gaining over 4,000 signatures in total.

Night-shift workers delivered a petition with 4,015 signatures to management during their 2:30 a.m. break on December 23. After reading out loud their demands for a meeting with management and paid time off, 36 of the 100 night-shift workers clocked out at 2:45 a.m. and walked off the job mid-shift.

    In an open letter, several engineers, researchers, analysts, and designers working with global companies such as Google and Facebook have condemned the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India. The letter, issued 'in solidarity with the Indian democracy', was posted through the 'TechAgainstFascism' handle on Medium. It called upon technology leaders to take a stance and publicly denounce the 'fascist acts by the Indian government'. 'We call upon the leaders to use technology as a force for good, to refuse to share user details with the government, refuse to shut off the Internet at the government's whim, provide tools for citizen mobilization, and ensure that content moderation is not skewing pro-government,' it said.

Roughly 40 Spin workers—who collect, repair, deploy, and charge Spin’s fleet of more than 500 electric scooters on the streets of San Francisco—are now part of Teamsters Local 665, as first reported by the San Francisco Examiner. The union says workers want to negotiate for better pay, health care, and retirement security in their first contract.

    Injured former Amazon warehouse workers and labor organizers in Chicago are protesting dangerous work speed and high injury rates today outside one of the company’s brick-and-mortar stores in downtown Chicago. The action coincides with the release of a new report on injury rates in one of the region’s largest and most dangerous warehouses, MDW7, the first in Illinois with automated robots. The report and protest in Chicago coincides with the launch of a national coalition, known as Athena, of three dozen grassroots labor, antitrust, and digital rights organizations—the first unified resistance effort in the United States against the delivery giant.

'Open source is about inverting power structures and creating access and opportunities for everyone,' the letter, signed by 167 developers at the time of publication, reads. 'We, the undersigned, cannot see how to reconcile our ethics with GitHub’s continued support of ICE. Moreover, your lack of transparency around the ethical standards you use for conducting business is also concerning to a community that is focused around doing everything out in the open.'

    Amazon delivery station employees in Sacramento are demanding fair treatment and benefits equal to those of other Amazon workers. By Sunday, more than 200 workers had signed a petition requesting an explanation for why they receive fewer paid days off per year than typical Amazon warehouse workers. The workers, who call themselves Amazonians United Sacramento, say that unlike other Amazon employees, they receive no paid time off. These workers, who sort and prepare packages for final-mile delivery in a station called DSM1, said they were told by Amazon managers that they get less paid time off (PTO) because they are classified by the company as Class Q workers. The Sacramento employees said they were previously unaware of any such classification.

    Amazon was targeted by a UK-wide protest organised to coincide with Black Friday and Cyber Monday demanding an end to ‘appalling’ working conditions. Trade union GMB co-ordinated the British demonstrations to take place across two of the busiest shopping days of the year. 'Workers are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances,' GMB national officer Mick Rix said in a statement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited protesters outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield. The union cited figures suggesting there had been more than 600 ambulance call-outs to Amazon warehouses over a three-year period and just as many serious incidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive for various injuries.

    A group of roughly 200 Googler and other protesters rallied outside of the search giant’s offices in San Francisco on Friday, demanding the company reinstate two colleagues who they say were unjustly punished for workplace organizing at the company — calling it an attack on accountability and transparency in tech. Google has said the employees were placed on administrative leave for violating company policies about accessing sensitive internal documents and monitoring employees’ calendar events. They accuse management of targeting Rebecca Rivers and Laurence Berland, because of their involvement in worker activism at the company. Rivers helped put together a petition against Google’s work for US immigration enforcement agency Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and Berland was involved with employee protests about hate speech policies on YouTube. Protesters are demanding that Rivers and Berland be reinstated at work immediately. Organizers called their suspension an “attempt to silence workers,” in an email about the rally.

    Over 400 Facebook employees protested publicly against the company's treatment of foreign workers on H1B visas days after a Chinese employee committed suicide by jumping off the roof of a company building. Workers at the company have started publicly posting and speaking out about the mistreatment of international workers, who are only allowed to stay in the US if they are sponsored by their employer and thus face greater pressures not to speak out against working conditions. Two separate GoFundMe pages have been started to raise money for a memorial and a protest event (over $6,000) and for Chen's family (over $122,000). Facebook has since fired one of the employees who organized the protest, Yi Yin. Yin also spoke to the press about the suicide after the company instructed him not to speak about the suicide.

News outlets report that this is the first successful unionization of white-collar tech contractors. Workers intend to use their position to bargain for compensation, benefits, and job security comparable to Google employees. Google currently employs more contract workers (135,000) than direct Google employees (115,000) according to the Guardian. A group of Google employees have signed a letter of support and others have published a petition calling for the company to sign a neutrality agreement and abstain from union-busting tactics.

    Foodora couriers in Toronto are preparing to vote on union certification in what could create Canada's first unionized workforce of app-based workers. An application by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers was filed last week with the Ontario Labour Relations Board, months after a campaign was launched that addressed working conditions. The union says couriers intend to negotiate a better compensation model, health and safety protections when workers are injured and recognition of basic rights of workers that aren't recognized by Foodora, which classifies them as independent contractors. Update: In February 2020, the Ontario Labour Relations Board rules that Foodora workers are dependent contractors and have the right to unionize. In April 2020, Foodora announced it was pulling out of the Canadian market.

    YouTubers Union joined with German trade union, IG Metall, to launch the FairTube campaign. The campaign is calling for greater transparency into YouTube's monetization policy, individual responses to queries about videos that have been taken down by the site, creation of an independent mediation board, and formal representation from content creators in the company's decision-making process. In addition, FairTube has argued that YouTube's data collection policy for uploaded videos violates the GDPR. Leadership has given YouTube until Aug. 23rd to respond, threatening legal action if they fail to do so. YouTubers Union is designed to serve as a union for YouTube content creators and has over 20,000 Facebook members as of August 9th, 2019 but it is not clear how many are actively involved in the campaign. It does not require dues from its members.

This piece of legislation would require rideshare companies to extend employee benefits to their drivers, who are currently classified as independent contractors. Workers protested outside the Capitol building, spoke at a public comment session, and met with individual legislators to argue for the passing the bill. A separate coalition of drivers was organized to protest the bill on the grounds of maintaining flexible working hours. Uber encouraged drivers to attend an opposition rally via in-app notification, and both Uber and Lyft offered funding to cover certain fees associated with attending the rally. The Senate Labor Committee ultimately voted to pass the bill, sending it to the Senate floor.

While Microsoft pitches itself as an inclusive and progressive company — especially during Pride Month, with tweets and donations to LGBTQ+ causes — employees who have donated to the PAC say they have no control over which candidates are being supported, meaning that they have no say when the PAC financially supports bigoted candidates.

    Foodora couriers announced their intention to join a union of Canadian post workers and held a union drive. If successful, this would make Foodora workers the first app-based employees to unionize in Canada. In April 2020 the company announced its intention to leave the Canadian market and initiated bankruptcy proceedings, making the future of the business and the unionizing effort uncertain.

    A GitHub user called on those who condemn 996 to respond to Jack Ma's endorsement of the widely criticized work schedule by sending an official copy of China's labor law on May 4 to the Alibaba headquarters. Ma, founder of Alibaba and the richest man in China, dismissed outcry on social media over the grueling working hours in China's tech industry in a blog post on April 12. 'To be able to work 996 is a huge blessing,' he said. The GitHub post estimates 1,000 participants will participate.

    Hundreds of regular Didi drivers in Xiamen went on strike in protest against the company's advantageous policy towards drivers who have not yet formally registered. Drivers said their daily incomes had fallen to around 200-300 yuan per day, about the same as regular taxi drivers in the city, and that they were now struggling just to get by. After police arrived at the site of the protest and dispersed the crowd, the workers elected their own representatives to hold talks with the company, and vowed to continue with their protests until the situation improved.

The coders weren’t persuaded their employer should be using its technological might to help the government wage war, according to four current and former employees. After hearing the engineers’ objections, Urs Hölzle, Google’s top technical executive, said the air gap feature would be postponed, one of the people said.

'Some people think we don't need a union because they believe we work at a leading global IT companies and have well-paid jobs,' Kim Chul-soo, president of the Oracle labor union, said. 'It's not true at all.' Workers are suffering from a decline in real wages because there has been no increase in basic salary for the last 10 years, while half of the salary is based on incentives. Hiring scams similar to those at local banks, along with sexual harassment are also among the union’s accusations.

    Mechanical Turk workers and organizers collaborated with researchers at Stanford’s Crowd Research Collective to create Daemo, a crowd-sourced platform that provides a higher-paying alternative to Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Some Mechnical Turk workers involved with the project later came out in opposition to the original WIRED article in their own Medium article. They argued that WIRED incorrectly identified Daemo as a project originating at Stanford, as opposed to from the workers themselves and called for changes to Daemo's governing board.

    Mozilla employees used a number of means to call for the resignation of CEO Brendan Eich who donated $1,000 in 2008 to support California's Proposition 8, legislature that would have made gay marriage illegal in the state. Three of Mozilla Foundation's board members resigned in protest, and other employees took to social media and wrote blog posts. Other companies, most prominently dating site OKCupid, encouraged their users to stop using the Firefox browser. Eich did ultimately resign.

Older employees with longer tenures at the company, who would lose 30-40% of their pension checks as a result of the switch, protested this change with rallies, emails to the company, a new online website, and lobbying policymakers in DC.

    A law firm representing 10 current and former contract workers at Microsoft Corp. filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Tuesday against the software giant, seeking damages and full-time employee benefits for its plaintiffs and thousands of other 'misclassified' temporary employees. The 10 plaintiffs seek class-action status because they want to include some 6,000 current full-time Microsoft employees who have been 'misclassified as nonemployees' under 'various erroneous labels' and denied company benefits.

    Former Intel engineer Kourosh Kenneth ("Ken") Hamidi alleged wrongful termination and discrimination after his claims for workers' compensation, following a car accident, were denied and he was fired in 1995. He formed a small (~10 member) online group called Former And Current Employees of Intel (FACE-Intel) to coordinate six mass emails over 21 months to Intel employees about company wrongdoing. Intel sued Hamidi and the FACE-Intel group for "trespass to chattel" and "nuisance" resulting in the California Supreme Court's ruling in Hamidi's favor in Intel Corporation v. Hamidi (2003). The case is considered a landmark ruling on electronic employee communications and concepts of trespass.

    Polaroid workers affiliated with the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement (PRWM) rallied at an anti-apartheid protest in Technology Square in Cambridge, MA and organized what is believed to be the first anti-apartheid boycott of a U.S. corporation. The organization was founded by two of the company's Black employees, Caroline Hunter (a chemist) and Ken Williams (a photographer). The two employees discovered that Polaroid was selling equipment to the South African government that allowed for a racist system of surveillance known as passbooks. The company responded by the surveilling and threatening the workers, first denying and then continuing their operations, and starting a public relations campaign to improve their image.
