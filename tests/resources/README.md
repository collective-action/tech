# Collective Action in Tech
![Sync](https://github.com/organizejs/collective-action-in-tech/workflows/Sync/badge.svg)

This repository documents all collective actions from workers in the tech industry.

For the purposes of this project, the tech industry is defined to include any companies whose core business is information technology. We are excluding adjacent industries such as gaming and digital media.

The goal of this archive is to provide data and insights on organizing in the tech industry, to find the connections between different efforts, and to build worker power in tech.

**This repository is meant to be a live document. We need your help to ensure its accuracy and completeness! See the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about how to contribute.**
